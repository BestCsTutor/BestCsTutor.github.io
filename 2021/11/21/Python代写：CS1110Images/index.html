                <p>实现一个类似 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram" title="Instagram"> Instagram </a><br>的图像处理应用程序。<br>![Instagram](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Instagram_versione_%28santa_fiora%2C_peschiera%29.jpg/220px-">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Instagram_versione_%28santa_fiora%2C_peschiera%29.jpg/220px-</a><br>Instagram_versione_%28santa_fiora%2C_peschiera%29.jpg)</p>
<h2 id="Requirement"><a href="#Requirement" class="headerlink" title="Requirement"></a>Requirement</h2><p>Instagram claims that it is site for sharing photos online with friends. But<br>it became popular for its easy to use photo editing tools and image filters In<br>this assignment, you will learn how to make your own image filters. While they<br>may not be as fancy as the ones provided by Instagram, this assignment will<br>still teach the basic principles to help you with your own start-up someday.<br>As we have seen in class, an image is just a 2-dimensional list of pixels<br>(which are themselves RGB objects). So must of the functions&#x2F;methods that you<br>write in this assignment will involve nested for-loops that read a pixel at a<br>certain position and modify it. You will need to use what you have learned<br>about multi-dimensional lists to help you with this assignment.<br>One major complication is that graphics cards prefer to represent images as a<br>1-dimensional list in a flattened presentation instead. It is much easier for<br>hardware to process an 1-dimensional list than a 2-dimensional one. However,<br>flattened presentation (which we explain below) can be really confusing to<br>beginners. Therefore, another part of this assignment is learning to use<br>classes to abstract a list of pixels, and present it in an easy-to-use<br>package.<br>Finally, this assignment will introduce you to a Python package. This<br>application is a much more complex GUI than the one that you used in<br>Assignment 3. While you are still working on a relatively small section of the<br>code, there are a lot of files that go into making this application work.<br>Packages are how Python groups together a large number of modules into a<br>single application.<br>Important: This assignment is due just before the exam. To reduce stress, we<br>highly recommend that you follow the recommended micro-deadlines.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-Objectives"><a href="#Learning-Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Learning Objectives"></a>Learning Objectives</h2><p>This assignment is designed to give you practice with the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to implement a class from its interface. </li>
<li>How to enforce class invariants. </li>
<li>How to use a classes to provide abstractions. </li>
<li>How to write code for both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional lists. </li>
<li>How to manipulate images at the pixel level. </li>
<li>How to write code for an underspecified function or method. </li>
<li>How to program for unicode strings with foreign characters and emojis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Assignment-Overview"><a href="#Assignment-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Assignment Overview"></a>Assignment Overview</h2><p>This assignment requires you to implement several parts before you have the<br>whole application working. The key to finishing is to pace yourself, and make<br>use of both the unit tests and the visualizer that we provide.</p>
<h3 id="Assignment-Source-Code"><a href="#Assignment-Source-Code" class="headerlink" title="Assignment Source Code"></a>Assignment Source Code</h3><p>UPDATE: We have discovered a bug in the provided code that prevents Windows<br>users from loading unicode text files with emojis. To fix the problem,<br>download the latest interface.py and copy it into the imager folder.<br>To work on this assignment, you will need to download three files.</p>

<h3 id="Suggested-Micro-Deadlines"><a href="#Suggested-Micro-Deadlines" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Micro-Deadlines"></a>Suggested Micro-Deadlines</h3><p>This assignment has a problem: it is due the day before the exam. There is not<br>too much we can do about this (other than making it due earlier). The last<br>assignment must go out the day of the exam. In addition, everything in this<br>assignment will be covered on the exam. So you really want to have this<br>assignment completed beforehand, as it is one of the best ways to study.<br>With that said, we understand if you want to study in other ways (such as<br>working on the old prelims. That is why, at the end of each part of the<br>assignment, we have a suggested completion date. While this is not enforced,<br>we recommend that you try to hit these deadlines. If you cannot make these<br>deadlines, it might be a sign that you are having difficulty and need some<br>extra help. In that case, you should go to office hours page as soon as<br>possible.</p>
<h3 id="The-Imager-Application"><a href="#The-Imager-Application" class="headerlink" title="The Imager Application"></a>The Imager Application</h3><p>Because there are so many files involved, this application is handled a little<br>differently from previous assignments. To run the application, keep all of the<br>files inside of the folder imager. Do not rename this folder. To run the<br>program, change the directory in your command shell to just outside of the<br>folder imager and type<br>    python imager<br>In this case, Python will run the entire folder. What this really means is<br>that it runs the script in <strong>main</strong>.py. This script imports each of the other<br>modules in this folder to create a complex application.<br>Right now, this application will not do anything. However, once you complete<br>the Image class], it will display two images of your instructor, like this:<br>As you work with this application, the left image will not change; it is the<br>original image. The right image will change as you click buttons. The actions<br>for the buttons Invert and Rotate.., are already implemented. Click on them to<br>see what they do.<br>You will notice that this takes a bit of time (your instructor’s computer<br>takes 2-3 seconds for most operations). The default image is 512x512. This is<br>over 250 thousand pixels. The larger the image, the slower it will be. With<br>that said, if you ever find this taking more than 30 seconds, your program is<br>likely stuck and has a bug in it.<br>The effects of the buttons are cumulative. You can undo the last effect<br>applied with Image.. Undo. To remove all of the effects, choose Image.. Clear.<br>This will revert the right image to its original state.<br>You can load a new image at any time using the Image.. Load button.<br>Alternatively, you can start up with a new image by typing<br>    python imager myimage.png<br>where myimage.png is your image file. The program can handle PNG, JPEG, and<br>GIF (not animated) files. You also can save the image on the right at any time<br>by choosing Image.. Save. You can only save as a PNG file. The other formats<br>cause problems with Part 3 of the assignment.<br>The remaining buttons of the application are not implemented. Reflect..<br>Horizontal works but the vertical choice does not. In Part 2 of the<br>assignment, you will write the code to make them work.<br>If you are curious about how this application works, most of the code is in<br>interface.py and filter.kv. The file filter.kv arranges the buttons and colors<br>them. The module filter.py contains Python code that tells what the buttons<br>do. However, the code in this module is quite advanced and we do not expect<br>you to understand any of it.</p>
<h3 id="The-Encoder-Features"><a href="#The-Encoder-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Encoder Features"></a>The Encoder Features</h3><p>Next to the Image.. button, you will see a button for Text… This button is<br>used by the last part of the assignment, to store secret messages in text. To<br>access these features, choose Text.. Show.<br>When you do this for the first time, you will see an error message that says<br>“No hidden message found”. This is perfectly normal. You have not encoded<br>anything yet, so there is nothing to decode. As a rule, the application will<br>always decode the message hidden in the file at start-up, and you will see<br>that error if there is no message.<br>To encode a message (once you have completed Part 3), type text in the box on<br>the right. The box will change color to blue if you have unsaved changes. Once<br>you press the Encode button, it will write the message inside the image and<br>change color back. At this point, you will probably want to save the image to<br>a PNG file to decode later. Applying any of the image filters (invert,<br>reflect, etc.) will corrupt the hidden message and cause it to be lost.<br>Typing text in the box is a lot of work. Therefore, you can always read from a<br>text file (or even a .py file). If you chose Text.. Import, this will load the<br>file into the box on the right. However, it will not encode the text until you<br>chose to do so. Hence, the text box will be blue after the file is loaded.<br>Similarly, you can save the decoded text to a file with Text.. Export. These<br>file features will be very useful for debugging more complex messages.<br>As we describe in the instructions below, your encode and decode operations<br>will support full Unicode (Asian characters, emojis, etc.). However the font<br>that Kivy uses cannot support emojis; it will display them as boxes with a<br>cross in them (to indicate “missing”). For example, if you import this text<br>into the application, you will see this<br>But if you export that text to a file, and open it up with an editor that can<br>display emojis, it will look correct. If you want to encode emojis, write them<br>in a text editor, import them, and encode. To get emojis back from a message,<br>you decode and export.<br>The undo functionality works for all of these features as well. Choosing to<br>undo will remove the most recently encoded message, restoring to a previously<br>encoded message.</p>
<h3 id="The-Integrated-Test-Script"><a href="#The-Integrated-Test-Script" class="headerlink" title="The Integrated Test Script"></a>The Integrated Test Script</h3><p>As with Turtles, debugging everything visually can be tricky. That is why we<br>have provided you with a (partial) test script to help you with this<br>assignment. This test script is integrated into the Imager application. To run<br>it, type<br>    python imager –test<br>The application will run test cases (provided in a6test.py) on the classes<br>Image, Filter, and Encoder, in that order. This is incredibly useful, since<br>you cannot even use the Imager app until you finish the Image class.<br>These test cases are designed so that you should be able to test your code in<br>the order that you implement it. Howevever, if you want to “skip ahead” on a<br>feature, you are allowed to edit a6test.py to remove a test. Those tests are<br>simply there for your convenience.<br>This test script is fairly long, but if you learn to read what this script is<br>doing, you will understand exactly what is going on in this assignment and it<br>will be easier to understand what is going wrong when there is a bug. However,<br>one drawback of this script is that (unlike a grading program), it does not<br>provide a lot of detailed feedback. You are encouraged to sit down with a<br>staff member to talk about this test script in order to understand it better.<br>As with the Turtles assignment, this test script is not complete. It does not<br>have full coverage of all the major cases, and it may miss some bugs in your<br>code. It is just enough to ensure that the GUI application is working<br>correctly. You may lose points during grading even if you pass all the tests<br>in this file (our grading program has a lot more tests). Therefore, you may<br>want to add additional tests as you debug. With that said, we do not want you<br>to submit the file a6test.py when you are done, even if you made modifications<br>to the file.</p>
<h2 id="Assignment-Instructions"><a href="#Assignment-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Assignment Instructions"></a>Assignment Instructions</h2><p>There are so many parts to the Imager application that this assignment can<br>feel very overwhelming. But in these instructions we take you through<br>everything step-by-step. As long as you pay close attention to the<br>specifications, you should be able to complete everything. This assignment may<br>take longer than the others, but it is well within your ability.</p>
<h3 id="Task-0-Pixel-Representation"><a href="#Task-0-Pixel-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Task 0: Pixel Representation"></a>Task 0: Pixel Representation</h3><p>You do not ever need to worry about writing code to load an image from a file.<br>There are other modules in imager that handle that step for you. Those modules<br>use the PIL module to extract pixel data from a file. The functions in this<br>module return the image as a flattened list of pixels.<br>To understand what we mean by this, let’s talk about pixels first. A pixel is<br>a single RGB (red-green-blue) value that instructs you computer monitor how to<br>light up that portion of the screen. Each RGB component is given by a number<br>in the range 0 to 255. Black is represented by (0, 0, 0), red by (255, 0, 0),<br>green by (0, 255, 0), blue by (0, 0, 255), and white by (255, 255, 255).<br>In previous assignments, we stored these pixels as an RGB object defined in<br>the introcs module. These were mutable objects where you could change each of<br>the color values, and these objects would automatically enforce the 0..255<br>invariant. However, the pixels in this assignment will be 3-element tuples of<br>integers. That is because they are faster to process, and Kivy prefers this<br>format. Because image processing is slow enough already, we have elected to<br>stick with this format. In addition, this means that you get some experience<br>checking and enforcing that the pixels are in the correct format.<br>So if that is what we mean by a pixel, what is a “flattened list of pixels”?<br>We generally think of an image as a rectangular list of pixels, where each<br>pixel has a row and column (indicating its position on the screen). For<br>example, a 3x4 pixel art image would look something like the illustration<br>below. Note that we generally refer to the pixel in the top left corner as the<br>“first” pixel.<br>However, graphics cards really like images as one-dimensional list. One-<br>dimensional lists are a lot faster to process and are more natural for custom<br>hardware. So a graphics card will flatten this image into the following one-<br>dimensional list.<br>If you look at this picture carefully, you will notice that is it is very<br>similar to row-major order introduced in class. Suppose we represented the 3x4<br>image above as follows:<br>    E00 E01 E02 E03<br>    E10 E11 E12 E13<br>    E20 E21 E22 E23<br>The value Eij here represents the pixel at row i and column j. If were were to<br>represent this image as a two-dimensional list in Python, we would write.<br>    [[E00, E01, E02, E03], [E10, E11, E12, E13], [E20, E21, E22, E23]]<br>Flattened representation just removes those inner brackets, so that you are<br>left with the one-dimensional list.<br>    [E00, E01, E02, E03, E10, E11, E12, E13, E20, E21, E22, E23]<br>This is the format that the Image class will use to store the image. If you do<br>not understand this, you should talk to a staff member before continuing.</p>
<h4 id="Precondition-Enforcement"><a href="#Precondition-Enforcement" class="headerlink" title="Precondition Enforcement"></a>Precondition Enforcement</h4><p>Throughout this assignment, you will be asked to enforce preconditions. A<br>common precondition that will come up over and over again is that a value is a<br>pixel, or a value is a pixel list. Inside of the file a6image.py are two<br>helper functions to help you enforce these preconditions: _is_pixel and<br>_is_pixel_list. The first has been completed for you. The second is<br>unfinished.<br>Before you do anything else, complete the function _is_pixel_list. Despite the<br>fact that this is a hidden function, we do test it in a6test.py. So you should<br>run the test script to verify that your implementation is correct.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>This is not a hard function, and it is very similar to some of the nested-loop<br>functions you have seen in class. But you did need to read all of these<br>instructions to get this far. So we recommend that you finish this part by<br>Tuesday, November 5. Finishing this part of the assignment will demonstrate<br>that you understand how pixels work and allow you to get started on the<br>assignment.</p>
<h3 id="Task-1-The-Image-Class"><a href="#Task-1-The-Image-Class" class="headerlink" title="Task 1. The Image Class"></a>Task 1. The Image Class</h3><p>For some applications, flattened representation is just fine. For example, if<br>you want to convert an image to greyscale, you do not need to known exactly<br>where each pixel is inside of the file. You just modify each pixel<br>individually. However, other effects like rotating and reflecting require that<br>you know the position of each pixel. In those cases you would rather have a<br>two-dimensional list.<br>The Image class has attributes and methods that allow you to treat the image<br>either as a flattened one-dimensional list or as a two-dimensional list,<br>depending on you application. This is what we mean by an abstraction. While<br>the data is not stored in a two-dimensional list, methods like<br>getPixel(row,col) allows you to pretend that it is.<br>The file a6image.py contains the class definition for Image. This class is<br>fully specified. It has a class specification with the class invariants. It<br>also has specifications for each of the methods. All you have to do is to<br>write the code to satisfy these specifications.<br>As you work, you should run the test cases to verify that your code is<br>correct. To get the most use out of the testing program, we recommend that you<br>implement the methods in the same order that we test them.</p>
<h4 id="The-Initializer-Getter-and-Setter-Methods"><a href="#The-Initializer-Getter-and-Setter-Methods" class="headerlink" title="The Initializer, Getter and Setter Methods"></a>The Initializer, Getter and Setter Methods</h4><p>To do anything at all, you have to be able to create an Image object and<br>access the attributes. This means that you have to complete the initializer<br>and the getters and setters for the three attributes: data, width and height.<br>If you read the specifications, you will see that these are all self-<br>explanatory. Note that these attributes are hidden, so the class invariant is<br>given by (hidden) single line comments according to our specification style.<br>The only challenge here is the width and height. Note that there is an extra<br>invariant that the following must be true at all times:<br>    width*height &#x3D;&#x3D; # of pixels<br>You must ensure this invariant in both the initialiers and the setters. In<br>addition, we expect you to enforce all preconditions with asserts.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-1"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-1" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>Except for the setters for width and height (which have the unusual<br>invariant), this part is no harder than the Pair class in Lab 8. So you should<br>be able to do this part quickly. We want you to get in the habit on working on<br>this assignment a little bit every day. That will make this assignment easier<br>and less stressful. That is why we recommend that you finish this part by<br>Wednesday, November 6.</p>
<h4 id="The-One-Dimensional-Operators"><a href="#The-One-Dimensional-Operators" class="headerlink" title="The One-Dimensional Operators"></a>The One-Dimensional Operators</h4><p>The getter getData already returns the image data as a flattened list of<br>pixels. So you might think we do not need to do anything more here. However,<br>notice that getData returns a copy of the pixel list. So it is not useful if<br>you want to modify the image. Instead, the class Image has methods to allow<br>modification of the image, while still enforcing the class invariant.</p>
<h4 id="The-Two-Dimensional-Methods"><a href="#The-Two-Dimensional-Methods" class="headerlink" title="The Two-Dimensional Methods"></a>The Two-Dimensional Methods</h4><p>The getPixel and setPixel methods present the image as a two-dimensional list.<br>This is a little trickier. You have to figure out how to compute the flat<br>position from the row and column. Here is a hint: it is a formula that<br>requires the row, the column, and the width. You do not need anything else.<br>Look at the illustrations in our discussion of flattened representation to see<br>if you can figure out the formula.<br>Figuring out the conversion formula is the only hard part of this exercise.<br>Otherwise it is the same as for the one-dimensional operators. Make sure to<br>enforce all of the preconditions.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-2"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-2" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>Because this is very similar to the one-dimensional operators, you should try<br>to finish this by the same day: Thursday, November 7. This pace will put you<br>in good shape for the more complicated functions in Task 2.</p>
<h3 id="Task-2-The-Filter-Class"><a href="#Task-2-The-Filter-Class" class="headerlink" title="Task 2. The Filter Class"></a>Task 2. The Filter Class</h3><p>The module a6filter.py contains the Filter class. You will notice that it is a<br>subclass of the Editor class in a6editor.py. The Editor class is complete; you<br>do not have to do anything with this class. It implements the Undo<br>functionality in the imager application. This class implements an edit history<br>and the getter getCurrent accesses the most recent update of the image.<br>You do not need to understand the Editor class at all, but you should read its<br>specification. Since Filter is a subclass, it will need to access the<br>inherited methods from Editor. In particular, you will notice that none of the<br>methods in Filter take an image as an input. Instead, those methods are to<br>work on the current image, which they access with the method getCurrent.<br>To make it easier to follow all this, we have provided you with several<br>example methods to study. You will notice that some filters - like invert -<br>modify the image with the one-dimensional operators. Others - like transpose<br>and reflectHori - modify the image with the two-dimensional operators. Use<br>this code as a guide for implementing the unfinished methods.<br>While working on these methods, you may find that you want to introduce new<br>helper methods. For example,jail already has a _drawHBar helper provided. You<br>may find that you want a _drawVBar method as well. This is fine and is<br>actually expected. However, you must write a complete and thorough<br>specification of any helper method you introduce. It is best to write the<br>specification before you write the method body, which is standard practice in<br>this course. It is a severe error not to have a specification, and points will<br>be deducted for missing or inappropriate specifications.<br>We have provided you with several test cases for these filters. But the output<br>of these test cases are limited and not always useful. A better way to test is<br>just to load the sample images and try them out. We have provided you with the<br>correct outputs for each filter applied to each sample image.</p>
<h4 id="Method-reflectVert"><a href="#Method-reflectVert" class="headerlink" title="Method reflectVert"></a>Method reflectVert</h4><p>This method should reflect the image about a horizontal line through the<br>middle of the image. Look at the method reflectHori for inspiration, since it<br>does something similar. This method should be relatively straightforward. It<br>is primarily intended as a warm-up to give you confidence.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-3"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-3" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>Because it is just a warm-up, you should be able to complete this and the next<br>method in one day. Assuming that you are keeping up with the recommended<br>deadlines, this means you should complete this part by Monday, November 11.</p>
<h4 id="Method-monochromify"><a href="#Method-monochromify" class="headerlink" title="Method monochromify"></a>Method monochromify</h4><p>In this method, you will change the image from color to either grayscale or<br>sepia tone. The choice depends on the value of the parameter sepia. To<br>implement this method, you should first calculate the overall brightness of<br>each pixel using a combination of the original red, green, and blue values.<br>The brightness is defined by:<br>    brightness &#x3D; 0.3 * red + 0.6 * green + 0.1 * blue<br>For grayscale, you should set each of the three color components (red, green,<br>and blue) to the same value, int(brightness).<br>Sepia was a process used to increase the longevity of photographic prints. To<br>simulate a sepia-toned photograph, darken the green channel to int(0.6 *<br>brightness) and blue channel to int(0.4 * brightness), producing a reddish-<br>brown tone. As a handy quick test, white pixels stay white for grayscale, and<br>black pixels stay black for both grayscale and sepia tone.<br>To implement this method, you should get the color value for each pixel,<br>recompute a new color value, and set the pixel to that color. Look at the<br>method invert to see how this is done.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-4"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-4" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>If you can figure out how to properly use the brightness value, this is<br>another short method. We recommend that you complete this part by Monday,<br>November 11. That way you will have more time for the harder methods.</p>
<h4 id="Method-jail"><a href="#Method-jail" class="headerlink" title="Method jail"></a>Method jail</h4><p>Always a crowd favorite, the jail method draws a a red boundary and vertical<br>bars on the image. You can see the result in the picture below. The<br>specification is very clear about how many bars to create and how to space<br>them. Follow this specification clearly when implementing the function.<br>We have given you helper method _drawHBar to draw a horizontal bar (note that<br>we have hidden it; helper functions do not need to be visible to other modules<br>or classes). In the same way, you should implement a helper method _drawVBar<br>to draw a vertical bar. Do not forget to include its specification in your<br>code.<br>This method is one where you have to be very careful with round-off error, to<br>make sure that the bars are evenly spaced. You need to be aware of your types<br>at all times. The number of bars should be an integer, not a float (you cannot<br>have part of a bar). However, the distance between bars should be a float.<br>That means your column position of each bar will be a float. Wait to turn this<br>column position into an int (by rounding and casting) until you are ready to<br>draw the bar.<br>When you are finished with this method, open a picture and click the buttons<br>Jail, Transpose, Jail, and Transpose again (in that order) for a nice effect.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-5"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-5" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>This method is a little more complicated than the previous filters, but it is<br>still not that bad. The hardest part of this method is making sure that you<br>are handling the round-off error correctly. We recommend that you finish this<br>method by Tuesday, November 12.</p>
<h4 id="Method-vignette"><a href="#Method-vignette" class="headerlink" title="Method vignette"></a>Method vignette</h4><p>Camera lenses from the early days of photography often blocked some of the<br>light focused at the edges of a photograph, producing a darkening toward the<br>corners. This effect is known as vignetting, a distinctive feature of old<br>photographs. You can simulate this effect using a simple formula. Pixel values<br>in red, green, and blue are separately multiplied by the value<br>Like monochromification, this requires unpacking each pixel, modifying the RGB<br>values, and repacking them (making sure that the values are ints when you do<br>so). However, for this operation you will also need to know the row and column<br>of the pixel you are processing, so that you can compute its distance from the<br>center of the image.<br>For this reason, we highly recommend that you use the method getPixel and<br>setPixel in the class Image. These methods treat the image as a two-<br>dimensional list. Do not use the one-dimensional operators. That was fine for<br>invert and monochromify, but that was because the row and column did not<br>matter in those methods.</p>
<h4 id="Recommended-Deadline-6"><a href="#Recommended-Deadline-6" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Deadline"></a>Recommended Deadline</h4><p>This is the last required method for the class Filter. It is also the hardest<br>method in this class. We recommend that you finish this method by Thursday,<br>November 14. This gives you more than a day to finish it, but still give you<br>enough time to work on the final task and to study for the prelim.</p>
<h4 id="Method-pixellate-OPTIONAL"><a href="#Method-pixellate-OPTIONAL" class="headerlink" title="Method pixellate (OPTIONAL)"></a>Method pixellate (OPTIONAL)</h4><p>The last method in the Filter class is not officially part of the assignment.<br>It is an optional method if you are looking for a challenge. You should only<br>work on this method when you have completed Task 3. If you implement this<br>method, and it is correct, we will reward you with extra credit. However, it<br>will be no more than 3 points and you cannot score above 100. So do not expect<br>this to replace an unfinished method.<br>Pixellation simulates dropping the resolution of an image. You do not actually<br>change the resolution (that is a completely different challenge). However, you<br>replace the image with large blocks that look like giant pixels.<br>To construct one of these blocks, you start with a pixel position (row,col).<br>You gather all of the pixels step many positions to the right and below and<br>average the colors. Averaging is exactly what it sounds like. You sum up all<br>the red values and divide them by the number of pixels. You do the same for<br>the green and blue values.<br>When you are done averaging, you assign this average to every pixel in the<br>block. That is every pixel starting at (row,col) and within step positions to<br>the right or down gets this same pixel color. This result is illustrated<br>below.<br>When you are near the bottom of the image, you might not have step pixels to<br>the right or below. In that case, you should go the edge of the image and<br>stop. We highly recommend that you write this averaging step as helper<br>function. It will greatly simplify your code in pixellate.<br>One thing you do need to watch out for is how you construct your loops in<br>pixellate. If you are not careful, the blocks will overlap each other, messing<br>up the pixellation effect. Think very carefully about what you want to loop<br>over.</p>
<h3 id="Task-3-The-Encoder-Class"><a href="#Task-3-The-Encoder-Class" class="headerlink" title="Task 3. The Encoder Class"></a>Task 3. The Encoder Class</h3><p>The last official part of the assignment is the most involved. The Encoder<br>class is built on top of the Filter class. That is because it is adding new<br>functionality to the Filter class and it needs access to the current image via<br>getCurrent. In fact we could have combined these two classes, but we separated<br>them for reasons of readability.<br>This class allows us to support steganography, which is “the art and science<br>of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one apart from the intended<br>recipient even realizes there is a hidden message.” This is different from<br>cryptography, where the existence of the message is not disguised but the<br>content is obscured. Quite often, steganography deals with messages hidden in<br>pictures.<br>This task is much more open-ended than anything we have done in the course<br>before. There is no right way to hide a message, and the way that you choose<br>to hide messages might be different than ours. All that matters is your decode<br>method can extract messages hidden by your encode method.<br>To decide how to best hide (and reveal) messages, you should read all of the<br>instructions below before starting on this class.</p>
<h4 id="Encoding-Bytes"><a href="#Encoding-Bytes" class="headerlink" title="Encoding Bytes"></a>Encoding Bytes</h4><p>A byte is an integer between 0 and 255 (this should look very familiar by<br>now). Computers are specifically designed to work with data in byte-sized<br>chunks, which is why they are so common. The American Standard Code for<br>Information Interchange (ASCII) is a way to represent Python strings as bytes.<br>Each character corresponds to a number 0..255. As you saw in an early lab, you<br>can use the function ord to convert a character to a byte and chr to convert a<br>byte back to a character.<br>It is very easy to encode a byte in a pixel. Suppose we have a pixel whose RGB<br>values are 199, 222, and 142 and we want to store the byte 107 (which<br>corresponds to the character ‘k’). We change the least significant digit of<br>each color component to one of the digits of 107, as shown below.<br>This change in each pixel is so slight that it is imperceptible to the human<br>eye (unless the image is a rectangle of just one color).<br>Decoding the message, the reverse process, requires extracting the last digit<br>of each color component of the pixel and forming a byte from the three<br>extracted digits, then converting that byte back to a character. In the above<br>example, we would extract the digits 1, 0, and 7 from the RBG components of<br>the pixel (using % 10) and put them together to form 107, which is the ASCII<br>value for ‘k’. Extracting the message does not change the image. The message<br>stays in the image forever.<br>Unfortunately, all modern text is Unicode, not ASCII. Unicode supports all<br>possible characters, including Asian characters and emojis. And Unicode<br>strings are supported in Python. Try this out in the interactive shell:<br>To keep the international students from feeling left out, we are going to use<br>Unicode this year instead of ASCII.<br>Unicode characters are not represented by bytes. Emojis require much larger<br>integers than 255. But the UTF-8 encoding is a simple way to convert an<br>unicode string into a list of bytes. All strings have an encode method that<br>allows you to do this conversion. Take the string s above and try the<br>following:<br>You will note that the number of bytes is longer than the length of the<br>string. In UTF-8, all ASCII characters are a single byte, but other characters<br>can be anywhere from one to four bytes.<br>You can also convert a list of byte-size integers back into a unicode string.<br>You need to use the Python bytes function to covert the list into a bytes-only<br>sequence, and then use the decode method as follows:<br>With this information, you can now use the technique shown above to hide or<br>reveal any Unicode string.</p>
<h4 id="Designing-an-Encoding"><a href="#Designing-an-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Designing an Encoding"></a>Designing an Encoding</h4><p>You are to write code to hide characters of a message text in the pixels of an<br>image in flattened representation, starting with pixel 0, 1, 2, Before you<br>write any code at all, you need to think about the following three issues and<br>solve them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Indicating an Encoding<br>First, you need some way to recognize that the image actually contains a<br>message. You need to hide data in the initial pixels 0, 1, 2, that has little<br>chance of appearing in a real image. That way, when program detects the data<br>in those first few pixels, it knows there is a message there. You cannot be<br>complete sure that an image without a message does still contain that data,<br>but the chances should be extremely small.<br>This beginning marker should be at least two pixels. If it is only one pixel,<br>then we can corrupt your message by transposing the image (think about this).<br>You can use more than two pixels, but the specification states that no more<br>than 10 pixels may be used for encoding information other than the message<br>text.</li>
<li>Indicating the Message Length<br>Next, you have to know where the message ends. You can do this in several<br>ways. You can hide the length of the message in the first pixels in some way<br>(how many pixels can that take?). You can also hide some unused marker at the<br>end of the message. Or you can use some other scheme. You may assume that the<br>message has fewer than one million bytes (e.g. the specification says that you<br>can refuse to encode longer strings), but you must be prepared for a message<br>with any sequence of bytes, including those produced by punctuation, emojis,<br>and foreign characters.</li>
<li>Staying within Color Bounds<br>Finally, the largest value of a color component (e.g. blue) is 255. Suppose<br>the blue component is 252 and you want to hide 107 in this pixel. In this<br>case, the blue component would be changed to 257. But this impossible because<br>a color component can be at most 255. Think about this problem and come up<br>with some way to solve it. There is a way to do this without having to change<br>the _decode_pixel helper that we have provided for you. However, you are<br>allowed to change _decode_pixel if you figure out another way to do it.<br>As you can see, this part of the assignment is less defined than the previous<br>ones. You get to come up with the solutions to some problems yourself. You<br>should feel free to discuss this part of the problem with the course staff.<br>They will not tell you how to solve these problems, but they will discuss your<br>ideas with you and point out any problems.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Complete-the-Methods-encode-and-decode"><a href="#Complete-the-Methods-encode-and-decode" class="headerlink" title="Complete the Methods encode and decode"></a>Complete the Methods encode and decode</h4><p>You should complete the body of the methods encode and decode in the class<br>Encoder. These two methods should hide a message and reveal the message in the<br>image. When you design decode, make sure it attempts to extract the message<br>only if its presence is detected.<br>Feel free to introduce other helper methods as needed. For example, we have<br>provided a helper method called _decode_pixel, which takes a pixel position<br>pos and extracts a 3-digit number from it, using the encoding that we<br>suggested above. This suggests that you might want to create a helper method<br>called _encode_pixel, which encodes a number into a pixel. The exact<br>specification of such a helper is up to you (if you start with our<br>specification, be sure to modify it as appropriate for your code).<br>Note that the answers to the three problems above greatly influence how you<br>write all of these methods. Therefore, the the specifications of these methods<br>must include any description of how you solved the three problems listed<br>above. For example, the specification of _encode_pixel must describe how you<br>handle the pixel overflow problem. In some case this may require modification<br>of specifications written by us. You can change anything you want in the<br>specification except the one line summary, the preconditions, and the last<br>paragraph (the one that describes the only cases in which the method may<br>fail).<br>As an aside, you will also notice that we use the operator <strong>getitem</strong> in<br>_decode_pixel. That is because it is very natural to think of an image as one-<br>dimensional list when encoding text. While an image is 2-dimensional<br>arrangment of values, text is not. Hence, once again, we see the advantage of<br>abstraction in Image, allowing us to access the data how we want for the<br>particular application.</p>
<h4 id="Test-the-Methods-encode-and-decode"><a href="#Test-the-Methods-encode-and-decode" class="headerlink" title="Test the Methods encode and decode"></a>Test the Methods encode and decode</h4><p>We have provided some simple tests (including emoji) for these methods in<br>a6test.py. So you should run the provided test script to check your answers.<br>However, the test script is not very useful when you have bugs and need to<br>find them.<br>Debugging encode and decode can be difficult. Do not assume that you can debug<br>simply by calling encode and then decode to see whether the message comes out<br>correctly. Instead, write and debug encode fully before going on to debug<br>decode.<br>How can you debug encode without debug. Start with short messages to hide (up<br>to three ASCII characters, each a single byte). Use the method getData() in<br>Image and slice off that many pixels from the list. Print these out and verify<br>that they are what you expect.<br>When encode and decode are both done, try hiding and revealing a long message<br>(e.g. 1000, 2000, or 5000 characters). This is where you really make use of<br>the Imager application. Use the Text.. Import feature to load in a text file<br>and try to encode that. We highly recommend that you try to encode a Python<br>program, as that is a good test of punctuation characters. International<br>students are free to try to use foreign characters (though they will not<br>display properly in the Kivy application).</p>
<h4 id="Save-your-messages"><a href="#Save-your-messages" class="headerlink" title="Save your messages"></a>Save your messages</h4><p>Clicking Image.. Save saves the image in the specified directory with the<br>filename you enter. The message is saved in .png format, which is a lossless<br>format. Saving in .jpg format would not work, because doing so tries to<br>compress the image, which would result in less space but would also clobber<br>your hidden message.<br>With .png, you can hide a message, save, quit, and then restart the<br>application with the message still there. If the message contained emojis or<br>foreign characters, they will not display in the Imager application, but you<br>can still export the result to a file with Text.. Export. You should try to do<br>that.</p>
<h2 id="Finishing-Touches"><a href="#Finishing-Touches" class="headerlink" title="Finishing Touches"></a>Finishing Touches</h2><p>Before you submit this assignment, you should be sure that everything is<br>working and polished. Unlike the first assignment, you only get one submission<br>for this assignment. If you make a mistake, you will not get an opportunity to<br>correct it. With that said, you may submit multiple times before the due date.<br>We will grade the most recent version submitted.<br>Once you have everything working you should go back and make sure that your<br>program meets the class coding conventions. In particular, you should check<br>that the following are all true:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have indented with spaces, not tabs (Atom Editor handles this automatically). </li>
<li>Functions are each separated by two blank lines. </li>
<li>Methods are each separated by one blank line. </li>
<li>Lines are short enough (~80 characters) that horizontal scrolling is not necessary. </li>
<li>Docstrings are only used for specifications, not general comments. </li>
<li>Specifications for any new methods are complete and are docstrings. </li>
<li>Specifications are immediately after the method header and indented. </li>
<li>Your name(s) and netid(s) are in the comments at the top of the modules.<br>You will submit only three files for this assignment: a6image.py, a6filter.py,<br>and a6encoder.py. Upload these files to CMS by the due date: Wednesday,<br>November 20. We do not need any other files. In particular, we do not want the<br>file a6test.py.</li>
