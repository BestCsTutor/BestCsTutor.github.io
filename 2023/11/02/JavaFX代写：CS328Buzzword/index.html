                <p>代写一个大型游戏，Buzzword，需要按照要求分步实现逻辑，同时需要将设计用UML图表示。  </p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Professaur Inc. provides custom software development approved by the<br>professor, incorporating the developmental aspects of approved software<br>projects including specification, design, implementation, and testing. At<br>Professaur Inc., we strive to build applications that exercise the mind while<br>still allowing enough room for relaxation. In particular, our focus is on<br>educational games.<br>Educational games should be easy to learn, easy to play, and yet not too easy<br>to master. The mechanics of the gameplay should be simple, so that the player<br>is only required to perform very simple actions - a usability aspect that is<br>becoming increasingly important in today’s world of touch screen mobile<br>devices where most actions should not require more than taps or swipes. In<br>spite of the simplicity of actions, a game can remain interesting to a player<br>if the intellectual difficulty required to master it is gradually increased.<br>This is a strategy where players compete with their own past selves. Of<br>course, intellectual competition can also be introduced in other ways, such as<br>having multiplayer modes.<br>The primary objective is, however, to make the learning process casual and fun<br>so that players learn even without consciously realizing it. BuzzWord, a<br>generalization of the popular word game “Boggle”, aims to fulfil exactly that<br>goal while helping players build up their vocabulary.<br>Much like Boggle, BuzzWord is a game where players are given a network of<br>connected letters, and they aim to identify as many words as possible, within<br>a limited amount of time. As players get promoted from one level to the next,<br>the promotion criteria to get into the subsequent levels become progressively<br>more difficult. Oh, and the game may ask the player to explain what the word<br>means if they want the points, that is.</p>
<h3 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h3><p>This document specifies how our BuzzWord game (version 1.0) should look like,<br>and what the gameplay must entail. It serves as a contract among all members<br>involved in the development of this product about the construction and the<br>appearance of the game, thus comprising the game mechanics from an operational<br>perspective as well as the game esthetics from the end users’ perspective.<br>The intended audience of this software requirement specification (SRS)<br>document is the entire development team, including game designers, artists,<br>software engineers and sales and marketing representatives who will ultimately<br>reach out to the consumers.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Scope"><a href="#Product-Scope" class="headerlink" title="Product Scope"></a>Product Scope</h3><p>For Professaur Inc., a company that is fully intent on capturing the<br>educational games market,<br>BuzzWord is the first of a many more word-games to come. Therefore, it is<br>crucial to make design decisions that will lead to reusable components. This<br>paves the way for framework(s) to be designed and constructed such that they<br>can be employed for similar other word-games in future. Likewise, this<br>document describes a Java Framework for Language Applications and Games<br>(JFLAG) that provides the foundational building blocks for the development of<br>such games. JFLAG, however, is specific to word-games, and is not meant to be<br>used as a general purpose framework for the development of all kinds of<br>educational games.</p>
<h3 id="Definitions-Acronyms-and-Abbreviations"><a href="#Definitions-Acronyms-and-Abbreviations" class="headerlink" title="Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations"></a>Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations</h3><ol>
<li>Educational games are games that are designed to help people to learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. </li>
<li>Word games are games that involve making, guessing, or selecting words. </li>
<li>IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), pronounced “I triple E”, is the world’s largest association of technical professionals. Its objectives are educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer engineering, and their allied disciplines. </li>
<li>A framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively used by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. In case of Java, a framework typically takes the form of a collection of classes and interfaces that can play such a foundational role. </li>
<li>A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. </li>
<li>Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard set of document formats for designing software graphically. </li>
<li>A use case diagram is a UML document format that specifies how a user will interact with a system. They do not include technical details, and are instead fed as input to the design stage where the appropriate software designs are constructed based in part on the use cases specified in the SRS.</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h3><p>This SRS consists of the esthetic and operational description of BuzzWord. It<br>does not include a software design description, and therefore, explains what<br>to do, but not how to build the appropriate technologies. The rest of this<br>document is divided into two main components: section 2 specifies the<br>conceptual design, including game rules and parameters, and section 3 presents<br>the game interface layout and the related functionalities.</p>
<h2 id="Overall-Description"><a href="#Overall-Description" class="headerlink" title="Overall Description"></a>Overall Description</h2><p>How good are you at identifying words, or perhaps even guessing words? In<br>BuzzWord, the player will be given a graph of letters, and s&#x2F;he has to<br>identify words that can be formed by connecting the nodes in this graph. The<br>longer the word, the higher its score! But of course, we don’t want people to<br>get points for randomly typing things, so the game may ask the player to<br>identify the correct meaning of the word. Failure to do so may carry a harsh<br>punishment! As players get promoted to higher levels, the graphs get more<br>complex, and the players are forced to guess longer words. As with most games,<br>BuzzWord can be played with friends (or enemies) in a two-player mode, where<br>players take turns to display their linguistic prowess.</p>
<h3 id="Product-Perspective"><a href="#Product-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="Product Perspective"></a>Product Perspective</h3><p>BuzzWord is an independent and stand-alone educational game. It should be a<br>game that starts easy, but gradually increases in difficulty. The gameplay<br>itself should be simple, with actions required being no more complex than<br>clicks, drags, and&#x2F;or simple keystrokes. As an educational game, it should<br>cultivate a player’s language skills and reward a player with more advanced<br>and challenging levels.<br>Balancing the difficulty with intellectual pleasure is often a difficult line<br>to walk.</p>
<h4 id="System-Interfaces"><a href="#System-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="System Interfaces"></a>System Interfaces</h4><p>BuzzWord will need a splash screen as the application home where a player<br>begins, a level selection mechanism, a game selection mechanism (e.g., to<br>starts a new game or load a previously saved game), a game mode selection<br>mechanism (e.g., single player or multi-player), and some obvious way of<br>accessing the help section of the game.</p>
<h4 id="User-Interfaces"><a href="#User-Interfaces" class="headerlink" title="User Interfaces"></a>User Interfaces</h4><p>As with many simple games intended for younger users, we want to develop<br>BuzzWord and other educational games in a manner that makes easily portable to<br>mobile platforms. Thus, the controls need to be simple and primarily based on<br>mouse-clicks. However, we would also like to have keyboard shortcuts so that<br>PC users can also play with ease.<br>In the remainder of this document, a “click” will always refer to a left-<br>click, unless otherwise stated.<br>Similarly, “drag” will always refer to a mouse drag with the press of the left<br>mouse button. Table 2.1 lists the various screens in BuzzWord, and Table 2.2<br>enumerates the player interactions with it.<br>Use Case 1: Create Profile</p>
<ol>
<li>Goal: Player wishes to create a new profile. </li>
<li>Preconditions: The application has been started, and the user is viewing the home screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: User clicks the “Create New Profile” button. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + P </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player starts the application, which loads the home screen (a splash screen with multiple options, one of which is to create a new player profile.<br>* Player wants to create a new profile, so clicks the “Create New Profile” button.<br>* Player is taken to the profile settings screen, where s&#x2F;he can create and save the new profile. <ul>
<li>The location and format of the stored profile information remains hidden from the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceptions: Creating a new profile is enabled only when the user is not logged in. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of button should be finalized by UI designer. The location and format of profile-related information and how it is packaged in the application code is a decision left to the software engineer(s).<br>Use Case 2: Login&#x2F;Logout</li>
<li>Goal: If player is logged in, log out. Else, allow player to log in. </li>
<li>Preconditions: The application has been started, and the user is viewing the home screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: User clicks the login&#x2F;logout button, which is a toggle button (i.e., if logged in, the current user gets to log out, otherwise s&#x2F;he gets to log in). </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + L </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player is viewing the home screen. At this point, player may wish to log in with a previously created profile, and thus clicks the login button, or the player was already logged in and now wishes to log out.<br>* Upon clicking the toggle button, a pop-up appears that allows the player to enter the profile name and password if logging in. If the button is clicked while player was already logged in, then the pop-up asks the player to confirm logging out.<br>* When credentials are correctly entered in step 5.2, all profile information including all prior progress of this profile are loaded into the application, even though this progress information is not visible on the home screen.<br>* The home screen shows the profile name after login.<br>* The home screen shows no profile name after logout. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of button should be finalized by UI designer.<br>Use Case 3: Start Playing</li>
<li>Goal: Start playing BuzzWord. </li>
<li>Preconditions: The application has been started, and the player is currently logged in. At this stage, the home screen has enabled the option to start playing a new game. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks the “Start Playing” button. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + P </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* If the player is logged in, s&#x2F;he is allowed to click the “Start Playing” button on the home screen.<br>* Player wants to start playing, and thus clicks the “Start Playing” button.<br>* After clicking the button, the home screen is replaced by the level selection screen, which continues to display the profile name, and correctly displays all past progress made by this player. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of button should be finalized by UI designer.<br>Use Case 4: Select Level</li>
<li>Goal: Allow player to select any level that has been unlocked based on past progress. </li>
<li>Precondition: Having chosen to start playing, player is viewing the level selection screen. The level selection screen displays all the levels of BuzzWord, but only the unlocked levels are clickable. More advanced levels remain disabled. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks one of the unlocked levels. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player has chosen to start playing, and is currently viewing the level selection screen.<br>* Player clicks a level from this screen. If the level is unlocked, the gameplay screen is loaded for that level. Otherwise (i.e., player clicks a level not yet unlocked) nothing happens. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: The layout of the level selection screen, including the design of individual level buttons, should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 5: Select Game Mode</li>
<li>Goal: Select a particular game mode, as determined by the player. </li>
<li>Precondition: Player is logged in, and is viewing the home screen. One of the options on this screen is to choose a game mode. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks the button to select the game mode. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player has already logged in, and wants to play BuzzWord in one of the many modes available (e.g., “Places”, “Animal”, “Dictionary Words”).<br>* Player clicks the button to select the game mode.<br>* Player then chooses a particular mode. Note that choice of mode affects the level selection. A player may have advanced to higher levels in one mode, but only just beginning in a different mode. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: The method of selecting the game mode should be finalized by the UI designer (e.g., provide the various modes in a drop-down menu).<br>Use Case 6: View Help</li>
<li>Goal: Switch to the help screen. </li>
<li>Precondition: The application has been started and the user is viewing the home screen. One of the options on the home screen is to view the help for this application. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks the “Help” button. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Application has been started, and the user is viewing the home screen. One option on the home screen the “Help” button.<br>* User presses the “Help” button.<br>* Application loads the help screen. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the help button should be finalized by UI designer.<br>Use Case 7: Quit Application</li>
<li>Goal: Quit and close BuzzWord </li>
<li>Precondition: The application is running, and is on any one of the screens. </li>
<li>Trigger: User clicks the “X” button (there should only be one). </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + Q </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* User is viewing any one of the screens (see Table 2.1).<br>* User clicks the “X” button on the top-left (or top-right, as it may be) corner of the game application.<br>* The application provides a pop-up asking for confirmation about quitting.<br>* BuzzWord does not save partial progress within a level. However, if any new level has been cleared by the user between the last save and this point of time, that progress must be autosaved before the application quits.<br>* If user confirms, the application quits. </li>
<li>Exceptions: This button must always remain enabled. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the help button should be finalized by UI designer.<br>Use Case 8: Return to Home Screen</li>
<li>Goal: From any screen other than the home screen itself (see Table 2.1), pressing the home button makes the player return to the home screen. </li>
<li>Preconditions: User is viewing any of the screens other than the home screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: User clicks the “Home” button. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + H </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* User is viewing any of the screens other than the home screen, and clicks the home button.<br>* The application jumps back to the home screen.<br>* If the home button is clicked while in the middle of active gameplay, the gameplay is paused and a pop-up asking for confirmation appears. <ul>
<li>If the player confirms return to home screen, the in-play level is discarded and the application returns to the home screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the help button should be finalized by UI designer.<br>Use Case 9: Pause&#x2F;Resume Game</li>
<li>Goal: If a game is being played, then pause it. Otherwise, resume the game that has been paused. </li>
<li>Preconditions: The player is actively playing a level of the game on the gameplay screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player toggles pause&#x2F;resume. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player is playing a level of BuzzWord, busy trying to guess words within a limited time. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the gameplay, the player should have the ability to pause the game if need be (and of course, resume a paused game).<br>* Player toggles the pause&#x2F;resume button.<br>* An ongoing game is paused. A paused game is resumed. <ul>
<li>Players should not be able to “cheat” by getting extra time to observe the letter grid.<br>Therefore, a paused game must render the grid invisible.</li>
<li>When a paused game resumes, the grid must become visible again, in the exact same state in which the game was paused.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Priority: Non-essential, but helpful. </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the toggle should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 10: Select Word by Mouse Drag</li>
<li>Goal: While a game is being played, player can press the left-button of the mouse on a node in the letter grid, and drag it over other nodes one by one, thus forming a path in the grid. The path<br>* nodes as well as edges - should be highlighted during dragging. Any path that does not form a cycle should be considered valid for this case, even if it does not form a valid word. </li>
<li>Preconditions: Active play is in progress at some level on the gameplay screen. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: N&#x2F;A. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player presses the mouse button on a node in the letter grid. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player is actively playing a level on the gameplay screen.<br>* Player presses mouse button on a node in the letter grid.<br>* Player drags mouse button over other nodes before finally releasing it.<br>* As the mouse is dragged, a text area in the gameplay screen displays the word formed by the dragging action. This display is dynamically updated as the dragging action continues.<br>* Game logic forms a word comprising the letters on the path over which mouse was dragged, and takes action depending on whether or not the path resulted in a valid word. </li>
<li>Exceptions:<br>* The path must be a simple path, i.e., it should not form (or include) cycles.<br>* The mouse drag must be approximated well. In a time-sensitive game, players may get frustrated if quick but slightly inaccurate dragging actions are not accurately corrected. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Highlighting effects of the path and the text area design must be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 11: Select Word by Typing</li>
<li>Goal: While a game is being played, player can simply type a sequence of letters instead of using the mouse. In this case, ALL paths satisfying the sequence of typed letters (in the order in which they are typed) must be treated as potential candidates, as long as they are acyclic paths in the letter grid. As in Use Case 11, the paths should be highlighted, and this should be dynamic (i.e., as the player types). Any sequence of characters that appear as a valid path in the letter grid should remain under consideration, even if the word formed by that path is not a valid word. </li>
<li>Precondition: Active play in progress at some level on the gameplay screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: Player types an alphabetic character during active gameplay. Note that this could signal the beginning of a new word being guessed, or a letter being added to a partially-formed word. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player is actively playing a level on the gameplay screen.<br>* Player types a letter (i.e., anything from ‘a’ through ‘z’).<br>* If the letter is the first letter of a new word being guessed, EVERY occurrence of that letter in the grid is highlighted. Otherwise, only those paths in the grid that can be extended by appending a node containing the letter are highlighted.<br>* As the typing continues, the text area in the gameplay screen displays the word formed by the typing. This display, just like the path highlighting, is dynamically updated as the typing continues.<br>* Player hits the return key.<br>* Game logic forms a word comprising the letter-sequence, and takes action depending on whether or not it is a valid word. <ul>
<li>If there are multiple paths in the grid corresponding to the word, the game should still treat it as a single guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Constraint: The path highlighting and text area display esthetics must be identical to the design and esthetics of Use Case 11: Select Word by Mouse Drag. </li>
<li>Open Issues: Highlighting effects of the path(s) and the text area design must be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 12: Replay Level</li>
<li>Goal: While a game is being played, a player may realize that s&#x2F;he is not going to succeed in the current attempt at a certain level. In such a situation, the game provides the player with the option to immediately restart the current level instead of waiting for the clock to run out. The goal is to allow the player to successfully restart the current level at any point during active play. The player must also be allowed to restart the level after playing (successfully or not) a level completely. </li>
<li>Preconditions: Player is viewing the gameplay screen, and active play is in progress (or has finished) at some level on the gameplay screen. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + R </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks the “Restart Level” button. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player is actively playing, or has finished playing, a level on the gameplay screen.<br>* There are no popups (e.g., a popup appearing after the player has successfully finished playing a level).<br>* Player clicks the “Restart Level” button.<br>* The level restarts. <ul>
<li>A new letter grid is created upon restart. </li>
<li>The game timer is reset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the restart button should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 13: Start Next Level</li>
<li>Goal: Start the game play for the subsequent level in the same game mode, once the player has successfully completed the current level. </li>
<li>Preconditions: Player is viewing the gameplay screen, and has successfully completed current level. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + ] </li>
<li>Trigger: Player clicks the “Play Next Level” button. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player has successfully completed a level on the gameplay screen.<br>* Player has closed any popups that may have appeared.<br>* The “Play Next Level” button is enabled.<br>* Player clicks “Play Next Level” button.<br>* Gameplay screen displays the next level. </li>
<li>Exceptions: The “Play Next Level” button should not be rendered (or enabled) unless and until the player has successfully completed the current level. Unsuccessful attempts at the current level implies the subsequent levels remain locked, unless the player profile indicates that higher levels were already unlocked by a previous successful attempt at the current level. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the button should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Whether the play starts immediately once the next level is displayed, or the<br>player has to provide an action (e.g., mouse click or key stroke) to begin the<br>play at the next level is also a decision left to the designer.<br>Use Case 14: Save Progress</li>
<li>Goal: Save all the progress made by the current player. In BuzzWord, partially played levels cannot be saved. Successfully completing a new level, however, unlocks higher levels, thereby changing the game state. Any successful completion, therefore, must be allowed to be saved. </li>
<li>Preconditions: For the first time, player has successfully completed the current level in this particular game mode. </li>
<li>Key Shortcut: Ctrl + S </li>
<li>Trigger: No separate trigger required, other than clearing a new level. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player has successfully completed a level on the gameplay screen.<br>* This level had never before been cleared by this player on this mode of the game.<br>* Player has cleared at least one new level in some game mode since the last time this player’s progress was saved.<br>* The “Save Progress” button is enabled.<br>* Player clicks the “Save Progress” button. <ul>
<li>Progress is saved automatically. Player does not get explicit access to where or how progress information is saved. <ul>
<li>“Save Progress” button returns to disabled state.</li>

<li>Exceptions: The “Save Progress” button should only be enabled if 4.3 holds true. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Size, location and style of the restart button should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>The location and format of progress-related information and how it is packaged<br>in the application code is a decision left to the software engineer(s).<br>Use Case 15: Close “Personal Best” Dialog</li>
<li>Goal: Notify the player that his&#x2F;her latest attempt at the current level in this mode of gameplay was his&#x2F;her personal best so far. </li>
<li>Preconditions:<br>* Player is viewing the gameplay screen, and has finished playing a level in a certain game mode.<br>* Whether or not player was successful in clearing this level, this attempt was his&#x2F;her best attempt so far (i.e., in the complete history of the profile). </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player finished playing a level in a certain game mode.<br>* A popup informs the player that this was his&#x2F;her best attempt at this level in this mode.<br>* The popup has a single “Close” button.<br>* Player clicks the popup’s “Close” button.<br>* Popup closes and player is viewing the gameplay screen at the end of a level’s play. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential </li>
<li>Open Issues: Style of the popup should be finalized by the UI designer.<br>Use Case 16: Scroll Through Help</li>
<li>Goal: Scroll up and down the help screen. </li>
<li>Preconditions: Player is viewing the help screen. </li>
<li>Trigger: Mouse scroll or up&#x2F;down arrow key press. </li>
<li>Scenario: Player is viewing the help screen, and is pressing the key up&#x2F;down buttons or using the mouse scroll. </li>
<li>Priority: Essential.<br>Use Case 18: Level Gameplay Ends</li>
<li>Goal: Display the complete “solution” to the current level’s letter grid when the time runs out. </li>
<li>Preconditions: Player is viewing the gameplay screen, and has exhausted the time limit for the current level. </li>
<li>Trigger: N&#x2F;A. </li>
<li>Scenario:<br>* Player has run out of time while playing at the current level.<br>* Player has not been successful in clearing the current level.<br>* The gameplay screen displays all valid words that could have been extracted from the letter grid in the “Guessed Words” display area. <ul>
<li>The “Guessed Words” display area must provide an obvious visual distinction between the words that were guessed by the player and the words that remained unguessed.</li>

<h4 id="Operations"><a href="#Operations" class="headerlink" title="Operations"></a>Operations</h4><p>A. Goals<br>In BuzzWord, the goal is start easy, and get gradually more difficult as the<br>player gets into higher levels. Section 3.1.2 provides an example of the<br>layout of the level selection screen.<br>B. Game Mode Selection<br>This game offers multiple modes (e.g., normal dictionary words, famous people,<br>etc.). Game mode selection can be done from the home screen.<br>C. Game Play Logic<br>The game play consists of a target score that the player must reach at each<br>level, and a time limit within which the player must do so. The exact time<br>limit and target scores are decisions left to the game developers. While<br>playing, the words guessed by the player are shown in a display, along with<br>their scores. The total score is also displayed so that the player knows how<br>far away s&#x2F;he is from salvation!<br>The details of the user interface are provided in Section 3.1.3. A few<br>additional things to note:  </p>
<ol>
<li>During gameplay, the player should have some option to restart the game<br>(with a newly generated grid) without waiting for time to run out. The<br>external interface decisions (e.g., an additional restart button) about this<br>are left to the game developers.  </li>
<li>When a game ends (at some level): a) All words that could have been guessed<br>by the player, but weren’t, must be added to the display in a visually<br>distinct manner (similar to how unguessed letters in the target word were<br>displayed in Hangman in the second homework). b) The total possible score at<br>that level should also be displayed. The idea is that the player should. c)<br>The play button should get enabled again. This is how the player replay the<br>same level after s&#x2F;he fails to clear the level. d) An additional button must<br>appear, clicking which should allow the player to move back to the level<br>selection screen directly without going to the home screen.</li>

<h4 id="Home-Screen"><a href="#Home-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Home Screen"></a>Home Screen</h4><p>Fig. 3.1: The home screen immediately after the application has started<br>running. At this point, the user has not logged in, and therefore, s&#x2F;he cannot<br>start playing a game immediately.<br>Fig. 3.2: The home screen after player has logged in using the credentials for<br>an existing player profile. Here, the “Create New Profile” button is no longer<br>present, and two new buttons have appeared<br>Fig. 3.3: The game offers multiple modes of play such as English dictionary<br>words, or specialized domains like scientific terms, names of places or famous<br>people. Before starting to play, the player may not actively choose a game<br>mode. Then, the mode in which the player was playing before exiting the<br>application during the previous login will be implicitly selected. If the<br>player is new, the English dictionary mode will be implicitly selected.<br>As you can see, in all three scenarios, the home screen always provides the<br>user with the simple option of quitting the application by clicking on the<br>cross on the top-right corner. In addition to clicking buttons that make the<br>player move away from the home screen, there is one special scenario where the<br>home screen is visible, but inactive. This is when the user clicks on the<br>login button.<br>Fig. 3.4: User has clicked the login button, and the login screen pops up,<br>disabling the home screen that is visible behind. At this stage, a simple key<br>shortcut like Esc should remove the login screen (in case user does not want<br>to log in after clicking the button) and return to the initial active home<br>screen. Upon successful login, the home screen should be as shown in Fig. 3.2.<br>An unsuccessful attempt should provide a useful message to the user and ask<br>the user to enter the credentials again.<br>Note that in Fig. 3.4., even the cross on the top-right of the background<br>screen should not be active.<br>The only options for the user are to either enter the credentials<br>successfully, or press Esc to remove the login screen popup.</p>
<h4 id="Level-Selection-Screen"><a href="#Level-Selection-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Level Selection Screen"></a>Level Selection Screen</h4><p>Fig. 3.5: The level selection screen for player who has not yet cleared level<br>4 in the<br>“Famous People” game mode. This screen must display the locked and unlocked<br>levels with some visual distinction. Only the unlocked levels must be<br>clickable. It will usually be the case that a player has cleared different<br>levels in different game modes. The level selection screen should use saved<br>profile data to correctly display this screen.<br>Note that player can logout, go back to the home screen, or quit the<br>application from this screen.<br>Once the player clicks the button to start play, s&#x2F;he is taken to the level<br>selection screen. This screen displays all the levels in the game (for the<br>game mode chosen, even if the choice was implicit). Here, the developer must<br>take care to ensure that the player does not have access to higher levels<br>without having cleared the lower levels first. For example, if X has only<br>cleared levels 1, 2 and 3, then only the levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accessible.<br>Levels 5 and above should be locked or disabled in some other manner. The<br>display choices are left to the designer. Fig. 3.5 shows how this may be done.<br>In Fig. 3.5, when a player clicks an unlocked level, s&#x2F;he is immediately taken<br>to the gameplay screen.<br>This is where the action happens! Keep in mind that the player may choose to<br>practice on easier levels s&#x2F;he has successfully completed before, which is why<br>levels 1, 2 and 3 are also accessible in the level selection screen.</p>
<h4 id="Gameplay-Screen"><a href="#Gameplay-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay Screen"></a>Gameplay Screen</h4><p>Fig. 3.6: The gameplay screen shown here during active play. The player has<br>guessed a few words already, as shown on the right, along with the scores. The<br>total score is also displayed. Currently, with the countdown timer showing 40<br>seconds left, the player needs 35 more points to clear this fourth level. S&#x2F;he<br>is attempting to guess a word starting with “BU”. This is dynamically<br>reflected in the letter grid as the player types.<br>Note that ALL paths are reflected in the grid. Finally, the play button at the<br>bottom is disabled during gameplay. It was initially enabled. The player<br>clicked the button and the countdown timer started.<br>Every level requires the player to identify valid words in the letter grid.<br>That is, words that can be formed by connecting the letter nodes in an acyclic<br>path. The minimum word length is 3 letters, and there is no maximum limit. The<br>game has a scoring mechanism as described under “Operations”.</p>
