                <p>从头开始实现一款大型的RPG游戏Iceman，第四部分是实现游戏所需的各个Actor类。  </p>
<h2 id="You-Have-to-Create-Classes-for-All-Actors"><a href="#You-Have-to-Create-Classes-for-All-Actors" class="headerlink" title="You Have to Create Classes for All Actors"></a>You Have to Create Classes for All Actors</h2><p>The Iceman game has a number of different Game Objects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Iceman </li>
<li>Regular Protesters </li>
<li>Hardcore Protesters </li>
<li>Squirts of water (that can be shot by the Iceman) </li>
<li>Barrels of oil </li>
<li>Boulders </li>
<li>Gold Nuggets </li>
<li>Sonar kits </li>
<li>Water refills (that can be picked up to refill the Iceman’s squirt gun) </li>
<li>Ice<br>Each of these game objects can occupy a slot in the oil field and interact<br>with other game objects within the oil field.<br>Now of course, many of your game objects will share things in common - for<br>instance, every one of the objects in the game (Regular Protesters, the<br>Iceman, Ice, Boulders, etc.) has an x,y coordinate. Many game objects have the<br>ability to perform an action - to do something (e.g., move or shoot) - during<br>each tick of the game. Many of them can be potentially annoyed (e.g., the<br>Iceman and Protesters can be by annoyed by Squirts of water or bonked by<br>Boulders, etc.) and could be irritated to the point of quitting during a tick.<br>All of them need some attribute that indicates whether or not they are still<br>active&#x2F;alive (or they became inactive&#x2F;died during the current tick), etc.<br>It is therefore your job to determine the commonalities between your different<br>game objects and make sure to factor out common behaviors and traits and move<br>these into appropriate base classes, rather than duplicate these items across<br>your derived classes - this is in fact one of the tenets of object oriented<br>programming.<br>Your grade on this project will largely depend upon your ability to create an<br>intelligent set of classes that follow good object-oriented design principles.<br>Your classes MUST NEVER duplicate code or member variables - if you find<br>yourself writing the same (or largely similar) code across multiple classes,<br>then this is an indication that you should define a common base class and<br>migrate this common functionality&#x2F;data to the base class. Duplication of code<br>is the root of all evil in programming - it leads to bugs, inconsistencies,<br>code bloat, etc. and should be avoided whenever possible.<br>Hint: When you notice this specification repeating the same text nearly<br>exactly in the following sections (e.g., in the Regular Protester section and<br>the Hardcore Protester section, or in the Gold Nugget or Sonar Kit sections)<br>you MUST make sure to identify common behaviors and move these into proper<br>base classes. NEVER duplicate behaviors across classes that can be moved into<br>a base class!<br>You MUST derive all of your game objects directly or indirectly from a base<br>class that we provide called GraphObject, e.g.:<br>class Actor: public GraphObject {<br>public:<br>};<br>class Protester: public Actor {<br>public:<br>};<br>class HardcoreProtester: public Protester {<br>public:<br>};<br>—|—</li>
</ul>
<p>GraphObject is a class that we have defined that helps hide a lot of the ugly<br>logic required to graphically display your actors on the screen. If you don’t<br>derive your classes from our GraphObject base class, then you won’t see<br>anything displayed on the screen!<br>The GraphObject class provides the following methods that you may use in your<br>classes:<br>    GraphObject(int imageID, int startX, int startY,<br>        DIRECTION startDirection, float size &#x3D; 1.0,<br>        unsigned int depth &#x3D; 0);<br>    void setVisible(bool shouldIDisplay);<br>    void getX() const;<br>    void getY() const;<br>    void moveTo(int x, int y);<br>    DIRECTION getDirection() const;  &#x2F;&#x2F; Directions: up, down, left, right<br>    void setDirection(DIRECTION d);  &#x2F;&#x2F; Directions: up, down, left, right<br>—|—<br>You may use any of these methods in your derived classes, but you must not use<br>any other methods found inside of GraphObject in your other classes (even if<br>they are public in our class). You must not redefine any of these methods in<br>your derived classes since they are not defined as virtual in our base class.<br>    GraphObject(<br>        int imageID,<br>        int startX,<br>        int startY,<br>        DIRECTION startDirection,<br>        float size &#x3D; 1.0,<br>        unsigned int depth &#x3D; 0<br>    )<br>—|—<br>When you construct a new GraphObject, you must specify the following<br>parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>An imageID that indicates what graphical image (aka sprite) our graphics engine should display on the screen. One of the following IDs, found in GameConstants.h. </li>
<li>You must specify the initial x,y location of the object. The x value may range from 0 to VIEW_WIDTH-SPRITE_WIDTH inclusive, and the y value may range from 0 to VIEW_HEIGHT-SPRITE_HEIGHT inclusive. Notice that you pass the coordinates as x,y (i.e., column, row and not row, column.). </li>
<li>You must specify the initial direction that each game object will be facing. Acceptable values include: up, down, left, and right. The definitions for these values may be found in the GraphObject class within GraphObject.h. </li>
<li>You must specify the size of the image. Most images (e.g., Protesters, Gold Nuggets, the Iceman, etc.) will have a size of 1.0, which is the equivalent of a 4 squares by 4 squares on the screen. In contrast, Ice will always have a size of .25 making it 1 square by 1 square. </li>
<li>You must specify the depth of the image. This value indicates whether the image is in the foreground (0), in the background (10) or somewhere in between. If two images are displayed at the same location, the graph object with the smaller depth value will be drawn on top of the graph object with the larger depth value, either partially or completely obscuring it. We will specify what the depth should be for each of your GraphObject-derived classes in the sections below.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setVisible-bool-shouldIDisplay"><a href="#setVisible-bool-shouldIDisplay" class="headerlink" title="setVisible(bool shouldIDisplay)"></a>setVisible(bool shouldIDisplay)</h3><p>New GraphObjects start out invisible and are NOT displayed on the screen until<br>the programmer calls the setVisible() method with a value of true for the<br>parameter. setVisible(bool shouldIDisplay) is used to tell our graphical<br>system whether or not to display a particular GraphObject on the screen.<br>If you call setVisible(true) on a GraphObject, then your object will be<br>displayed on screen automatically by our framework (e.g., a Regular Protester<br>image will be drawn to the screen at the GraphObject’s specified x,y<br>coordinates if the object’s imageID is IMID_PROTESTER). If you call<br>setVisible(false) then your GraphObject will not be displayed on the screen.<br>NOTE: When you create a new game object, always remember that if you want it<br>to be displayed on the screen, you must call its setVisible() method with a<br>value of true!</p>
<h3 id="int-getX-const"><a href="#int-getX-const" class="headerlink" title="int getX() const"></a>int getX() const</h3><h3 id="int-getY-const"><a href="#int-getY-const" class="headerlink" title="int getY() const"></a>int getY() const</h3><p>These methods are used to determine a GraphObject’s current location on the<br>screen. Since each GraphObject maintains an x,y location, this means that your<br>derived classes must not also have x,y member variables, but instead use those<br>in the GraphObject base class.</p>
<h3 id="void-moveTo-int-x-int-y"><a href="#void-moveTo-int-x-int-y" class="headerlink" title="void moveTo(int x, int y)"></a>void moveTo(int x, int y)</h3><p>The moveTo() method must be used to update the location of a GraphObject<br>within the oil field. For example, if a Regular Protester’s movement logic<br>dictates that it should move to the right, you must do something like the<br>following:<br>    moveTo(getX() + 1, y); &#x2F;&#x2F; move one square to the right<br>—|—<br>You must use the moveTo() method to adjust the location of a GameObject in the<br>game if you want that object to be properly animated. As with the GraphObject<br>constructor, note that the order of the parameters to moveTo is x,y (col,row)<br>and NOT y,x (row,col).</p>
<h3 id="DIRECTION-getDirection-const"><a href="#DIRECTION-getDirection-const" class="headerlink" title="DIRECTION getDirection() const"></a>DIRECTION getDirection() const</h3><h3 id="void-setDirection-DIRECTION-d"><a href="#void-setDirection-DIRECTION-d" class="headerlink" title="void setDirection(DIRECTION d)"></a>void setDirection(DIRECTION d)</h3><p>These two methods are used to get and set the current direction the<br>GraphObject is facing. Valid values include up, down, left, and right.<br>Changing the direction causes our graphics engine to automatically rotate the<br>image appropriately before displaying it on the screen.<br>Now that you know about our GraphObject base class, you’ll need to derive all<br>of your game object classes based on this class (either directly, or<br>indirectly).</p>
<h2 id="The-Iceman-Class"><a href="#The-Iceman-Class" class="headerlink" title="The Iceman Class"></a>The Iceman Class</h2><p>Here are the requirements you must meet when implementing the Iceman class:<br>What a Iceman Object Must Do When It Is Created<br>When it is first created:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Iceman must have an image ID of IMID_PLAYER. </li>
<li>The Iceman must always start at location x&#x3D;30, y&#x3D;60. </li>
<li>The Iceman, in its default state:<br>* a. Is given 10 hit points<br>* b. Is given 5 units of water to squirt with his squirt gun (he may pick up additional Water in the oil field)<br>* c. Is given 1 sonar charge<br>* d. Starts out with zero gold nuggets<br>* e. Should start facing rightward </li>
<li>The Iceman has the following graphic parameters:<br>* a. It has an image depth of 0 - meaning its graphic image should always be in the foreground (above other images)<br>* b. It has a size of 1.0<br>In addition to any other initialization that you decide to do in your Iceman<br>class, a Iceman (or one of its base classes) must set itself to be visible<br>using the GraphObject class’s setVisible() method, e.g.:<br>setVisible(true);<br>—|—</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="What-the-Iceman-Must-Do-During-a-Tick"><a href="#What-the-Iceman-Must-Do-During-a-Tick" class="headerlink" title="What the Iceman Must Do During a Tick"></a>What the Iceman Must Do During a Tick</h3><p>The Iceman must be given an opportunity to do something during every tick (in<br>its doSomething() method). When given an opportunity to do something, the<br>Iceman must do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Iceman must check to see if it is currently alive. If not, then its doSomething() method must return immediately - none of the following steps should be performed. </li>
<li>If the Iceman’s 4x4 image currently overlaps any Ice objects within the oil field, then it will call upon the StudentWorld object to:<br>* a. Remove&#x2F;destroy the Ice objects from the 4x4 area occupied by the Iceman (from x, y to x+3,y+3 inclusive)<br>* b. Make a digging sound by playing the SOUND_DIG sound (see the StudentWorld section of this document for details on how to play a sound). </li>
<li>Otherwise, the doSomething() method must check to see if the human player pressed a key (the section below shows how to check if the user pressed a key, and if so, how to determine what key the user pressed).<br>* a. If the user presses the Escape key, this allows the user to abort the current level. In this case, the Iceman object should set itself to completely annoyed (aka dead). The code in your StudentWorld class should detect that the Iceman has died and address this appropriately (e.g., replay the level from scratch, or end the game if the player has run out of lives).<br>* b. If the user presses the spacebar key, then the Iceman will fire a Squirt into the oil field, assuming they have sufficient water in their squirt gun to do so. The Iceman will then reduce their water count by 1. To fire a Squirt, the player must create and add a new Squirt object into the oil field at a location that is four squares immediately in front of the Iceman, facing the same direction as the Iceman. So if the Iceman is at x&#x3D;10,y&#x3D;7, and he is facing upward, then the new Squirt object would be placed at location x&#x3D;10, y&#x3D;11, and the Squirt would be facing upward. Every time the Iceman fires a Squirt, it must play the sound SOUND_PLAYER_SQUIRT. If the initial location where the Squirt starts (i.e., 4 squares in front of the Iceman) is occupied by one or more Ice objects or is within a radius of 3.0 of a Boulder object, then the Iceman must still make a squirting noise and will waste 1 unit of water, but the Iceman must not add any Squirt object into the oil field and thus no damage can be done to any Protesters (it’s as if the Iceman shot water against a wall and it immediately dissipated).<br>Hint: One way to implement this is to have your Iceman create a new Squirt<br>object in the proper location and facing the proper direction, and then give<br>it to your StudentWorld to manage (i.e., to animate) along with your other<br>game objects.<br>* c. If the player wants their Iceman to turn to face a different direction then it is currently facing (by pressing one of the arrow keys), then the Iceman’s direction should be adjusted to the indicated direction but the Iceman must not move in that direction. For example, if the Iceman is currently facing up, and the player hits the right arrow key, then the Iceman should turn to face right, but not move right.<br>* d. Else, if the Iceman is already facing in a particular direction and the user hits the arrow key to move in that same direction, AND the Iceman is allowed to move in that direction (e.g., there is no Boulder in the way, and the position doesn’t take the Iceman outside of the oil field), then your code must use the GraphObject’s moveTo() method to adjust the Iceman’s location by one square in the indicated direction. Valid coordinates for the Iceman are from x&#x3D;0,y&#x3D;0 to x&#x3D;60,y&#x3D;60, inclusive. Moreover, the Iceman cannot occupy a square that is less than or equal to a radius of 3 away from the center of any Boulder.<br>* e. If the player presses the ‘Z’ or ‘z’ keys and the Iceman has one or more sonar charges remaining in his inventory, then this will cause the Iceman to use his sonar charge to illuminate the contents of the oil field within a radius of 12 of his location: <ul>
<li>i. The count of sonar charges held by the Iceman must be decremented by 1. </li>
<li>ii. All hidden game objects (e.g., Gold Nuggets or Barrels of oil) that are within a radius of 12 (e.g., this includes 11.99 squares away) must be made visible via setVisible() and revealed to the player. <ul>
<li>f. If the player presses the TAB key and they have one or more units of gold in their inventory, then they must add a Gold Nugget object into the oil field at their current x,y location and reduce their gold count by 1 unit. The dropped Gold Nugget must have a temporary state and a lifetime of 100 game ticks, and is only pickup-able by Protesters (either Regular or Hardcore). Such a dropped Nugget will start out in a visible state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

Hint: All<br>objects that can be annoyed should have some type of method that can be called<br>to annoy them.<br>If the Iceman’s hit-points reach zero or below due to being annoyed, the<br>Iceman must set its object’s state to dead, and then play an “I give up” sound<br>effect: SOUND_PLAYER_GIVE_UP. Note: The StudentWorld class should check the<br>Iceman’s status during each tick and if he transitions to a dead state, it<br>should return the appropriate value indicating that the player lost a life.</p>
<h3 id="Getting-Input-From-the-User"><a href="#Getting-Input-From-the-User" class="headerlink" title="Getting Input From the User"></a>Getting Input From the User</h3><p>Since Iceman is a real-time game, you can’t use the typical getline or cin<br>approach to get a user’s key press within the player’s doSomething() method.<br>This would stop your program and wait until the user types in the proper data<br>and hits the Enter key. This would make for a really boring game (requiring<br>the user to hit a directional key then hit Enter, then hit a direction key,<br>then hit Enter, etc.). Instead, you will need to use a special function that<br>we provide in our GameWorld class (which your StudentWorld class is derived<br>from) called getKey()to get input from the user. This function rapidly checks<br>to see if the user hit a key. If the user hit a key, the function returns true<br>and the int variable passed to it is set to the code for the key. Otherwise,<br>the function immediately returns false, meaning that no key was hit. This<br>function could be used as follows:<br>    void Iceman::doSomething()<br>    {<br>      …<br>      int ch;<br>      if (getWorld()-&gt;getKey(ch) &#x3D;&#x3D; true)<br>      {<br>        &#x2F;&#x2F; user hit a key this tick!<br>        switch (ch)<br>        {<br>          case KEY_PRESS_LEFT:<br>            … move player to the left …;<br>            break;<br>          case KEY_PRESS_RIGHT:<br>            … move player to the right …;<br>            break;<br>          case KEY_PRESS_SPACE:<br>            … add a Squirt in front of the player…;<br>            break;<br>          &#x2F;&#x2F; etc<br>        }<br>      }<br>      …<br>    }<br>—|—  </p>

<li>Each Ice object must start out facing rightward. </li>
<li>Ice has the following graphic parameters:<br>* a. It has an image depth of 3 - meaning its graphic image should always be in the background (all other game objects have smaller depth values)<br>* b. It has a size of .25, meaning it occupies only a 1x1 square in the oil field. In addition to any other initialization that you decide to do in your Ice class, a Ice object must set itself to be visible using the GraphObject class’s setVisible() method, e.g.: setVisible(true);</li>

<h2 id="Boulders"><a href="#Boulders" class="headerlink" title="Boulders"></a>Boulders</h2><p>You must create a class to represent a Boulder. Boulders basically sit around<br>until the Ice underneath them has been dug away, and then after a short delay,<br>they fall down until they hit the bottom of the shaft and disintegrate.

<ol>
<li>Check to see if it’s still alive. If not, its doSomething() method should immediately return. </li>
<li>If the Boulder is currently in the stable state, then it must check to see if there is any Ice in the 4 squares immediately below it. For example, if the Boulder is at location x&#x3D;20,y&#x3D;30, it would check squares (20,29), (21,29), (22,29) and (23,29) for Ice. If there is any Ice below the Boulder, it does nothing - after all it’s a dumb rock. However, if none of the 4 squares beneath the Boulder have any Ice, then the Boulder must transition into a waiting state:<br>* A. It must enter a waiting state for the next 30 ticks </li>
<li>If the Boulder is in a waiting state and 30 ticks have elapsed, then it must transition into a falling state and play the sound SOUND_FALLING_ROCK. </li>
<li>If the Boulder is in a falling state, then:<br>* A. It must continue to move downward one square during each tick until it either (a) hits the bottom of the oil field (i.e., it tries to move to y&#x3D;-1), (b) runs into the top of another Boulder, or (c) it runs into Ice (i.e., by moving down a square, the Boulder would overlap over one or more Ice objects). When any of the above conditions are met the Boulder must set its state to dead so it can be removed from the game at the end of the current tick.<br>* B. If the Boulder comes within a radius of 3 (i.e. less than or equal to 3 squares, so 2.99 would count) of any Protester(s) or the Iceman while falling, it must cause 100 points of annoyance to those actors (effectively completely annoying them in one fell swoop). The Boulder will continue falling down as described above, even if it annoys one or more Protesters on its way down (i.e., it won’t stop falling if it runs into a Protester). However, if the Boulder annoys the Iceman, the player will instantly lose a life.</li>

<h3 id="What-a-Regular-Protester-Must-Do-During-a-Tick"><a href="#What-a-Regular-Protester-Must-Do-During-a-Tick" class="headerlink" title="What a Regular Protester Must Do During a Tick"></a>What a Regular Protester Must Do During a Tick</h3><p>Regular Protesters, unlike the player, don’t necessarily get to take an action<br>during every tick of the game (this is to make the game easier to play, since<br>if Regular Protesters moved once every tick, they’d move much faster than the<br>typical player can think and hit the keys on the keyboard). The Regular<br>Protester must therefore compute a value indicating how often they’re allowed<br>to take an action (e.g., once every N ticks). This number of ticks (also known<br>as “resting ticks”) may be computed as follows:<br>    int ticksToWaitBetweenMoves &#x3D; max(0, 3 - current_level_number&#x2F;4)<br>—|—<br>So if the value of ticksToWaitBetweenMoves was 3, then the Regular Protester<br>must “rest” for 3 ticks and may perform its normal behavior every 4 tick. If<br>the value is zero, then the Regular Protester does something during every tick<br>of the game.<br>Here is what a Regular Protester must do during <em>every</em> tick:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Regular Protester must check to see if it is currently alive. If not, then its doSomething() method must return immediately - none of the following steps should be performed. </li>
<li>If the Regular Protester is in a “rest state” during the current tick, it must do nothing other than update its resting tick count, and immediately return. </li>
<li>Otherwise, if the Regular Protester is in a leave-the-oil-field state (because their hit points reached zero due to being repeatedly squirted by the Iceman’s squirt gun or bonked by a falling Boulder), then:<br>* a. If the Regular Protester is at its exit point (at location x&#x3D;60, y&#x3D;60) then it will immediately set its status to dead so that it will be removed from the game at the end of the current tick (by your StudentWorld class).<br>* b. Otherwise, the Regular Protester must move one square closer to its exit point (at x&#x3D;60, y&#x3D;60). It must determine what direction to move based on a queue-based maze-searching algorithm like the one we learned in class. The Regular Protester may not walk through Ice or Boulders to reach its exit point (meaning that none of the 16 squares that comprise the 4x4 Regular Protester icon may overlap with a Ice object and that the Regular Protester must not come within a distance of 3.0 units of any Boulders). Hint: It’s inefficient for every single Regular Protester to try to figure out its own optimal path to the exit, so see if you can figure out a way to compute a single data structure that enables all Protesters to quickly determine their optimal path to their common exit point of 60,60, no matter where they are located in the oil field.<br>* c. After moving one step toward their exit point, the Regular Protester will return immediately. It will not perform any of the following steps. </li>
<li>Otherwise, the Regular Protester will check to see if they are within a distance of 4 units of the Iceman, AND they are currently facing in the Iceman’s direction. If both are true and the Regular Protester hasn’t shouted within its last non-resting 15 ticks, then the Regular Protester will:<br>* a. Play the shouting sound: SOUND_PROTESTER_YELL<br>* b. Inform the Iceman that he’s been annoyed for a total of 2 annoyance points (deducting 2 points from the Iceman’s hit points, and possibly causing the Iceman to become sufficiently annoyed to quit the level (aka die)).<br>* c. Update some state variable in a manner that prevents this Regular Protester from shouting again for at least 15 non-resting ticks.<br>* d. Return immediately. </li>
<li>Otherwise, if the Regular Protester:<br>* a. Is in a straight horizontal or vertical line of sight to the Iceman (even if the Regular Protester isn’t currently facing the Iceman), and<br>* b. Is more than 4 units away from the Iceman - that is, the radius from the Regular Protester and the Iceman is greater than 4.0 units away, and<br>* c. Could actually move the entire way to the Iceman with no Ice or Boulders blocking its path (assuming it kept walking straight over the next N turns),<br>Then the Regular Protester will:<br>* a. Change its direction to face in the direction of the Iceman, AND then take one step toward him.<br>* b. The Regular Protester will set its numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection value to zero, forcing it to pick a new direction&#x2F;distance to move during its next non-resting tick (unless of course, the Regular Protester still sees the Iceman in its line of sight, in which case it will continue to move toward the Iceman).<br>* c. Then the Regular Protester will immediately return. </li>
<li>Otherwise, the Regular Protester can’t directly see the Iceman. As such, it will decrement its numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection variable by one. If the Regular Protester has finished walking numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection steps in its currently-selected direction, then:<br>* a. The Regular Protester will pick a random new direction to move (up, down, left or right).<br>* b. If the random direction is blocked either by Ice or a Boulder such that it can’t take even a single step in that chosen direction, then it will select a different direction and check it for blockage (it will continue checking directions until it has picked a direction that is not blocked).<br>* c. The Regular Protester will then change its direction to this new chosen direction.<br>* d. The Regular Protester will then pick a new value for numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection that will govern how far it should move in the selected direction over the next numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection non-resting ticks. The value must be such that: <code>8 &lt;= numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection &lt;= 60</code> .<br>* e. The Regular Protester will then continue with step 8. </li>
<li>Otherwise, if the Regular Protester:<br>* a. Is sitting at an intersection where it could turn and move at least one square in a perpendicular direction from its currently facing direction (e.g., it is currently facing left, and is at a junction where it could turn and move one step either upward&#x2F;downward without being blocked by Ice or a Boulder), and<br>* b. The Regular Protester hasn’t made a perpendicular turn in the last 200 non-resting ticks.<br>Then the Regular Protester will:<br>* a. Determine which of the two perpendicular directions are viable (a viable direction is one that allows movement of at least one square without the Regular Protester being blocked by Ice or a Boulder).<br>* b. Pick a viable perpendicular direction. If both perpendicular directions are viable, then pick one of the two choices randomly.<br>* c. Set its direction to the selected perpendicular direction.<br>* d. Pick a new value for numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection that will govern how far it should move in the selected perpendicular direction over the next numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection non-resting ticks. The value must be such that: <code>8 &lt;= numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection &lt;= 60</code> .<br>* e. Remember that it made a perpendicular turn so that it doesn’t make another perpendicular turn for at least 200 more non-resting ticks.<br>* f. Continue on with the next step. </li>
<li>Finally, the Regular Protester will then attempt to take one step in its currently facing direction (which, by the way, might have just been changed by one of the last few steps above). </li>
<li>If the Regular Protester is for some reason blocked from taking a step in its currently facing direction, it will set the numSquaresToMoveInCurrentDirection to zero, resulting in a new direction being chosen during the Regular Protester’s next non-resting tick (but not the current tick - the Regular Protester must do nothing during the current tick).<br>Note that only Ice and Boulders block a Regular Protester from moving. Regular<br>Protesters can occupy the same square as all other game objects including the<br>Iceman and other Protesters.</li>
