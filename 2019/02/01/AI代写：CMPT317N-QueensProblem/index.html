                <p>代写AI作业，用Minimax Search, Alpha-Beta Pruning等算法解决N-Queens问题。  </p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>The N-Queens problem is to put N Queens on a board (N * N) so that no queen<br>attacks any other queen. (A queen can attack any square on the same row, same<br>column, or same diagonal.) The following is a diagram of a game state with 2<br>queens on the board:<br>We will make a 2-player game of the N-Queens problem as follows: Players<br>alternate putting a piece on the board, and can only place a queen on a square<br>that is not being attacked, i.e., there is no queen already on the board in<br>the same row or column or diagonal. In the N-Queens game, the objective is to<br>be the last player to have a legal place to put a queen. We will work with two<br>variations of this game, which differ in 2 aspects: how players can play, and<br>how the score is counted.</p>
<h3 id="Variation-1a"><a href="#Variation-1a" class="headerlink" title="Variation 1a"></a>Variation 1a</h3><p>The players must place a queen on the left-most unoccupied column: Player 1<br>plays on Column 1, Player 2 on Column 2, Player 1 on Column 3, etc). For<br>example, in the above diagram, it’s Player 1’s turn to move, and Player 1 must<br>place a queen somewhere in column 3 (counting from the left, starting at 1).<br>The winner is the last player to put a queen on the board. For example, if<br>it’s Player 1’s turn to play in Column 5, but all squares in Column 5 are<br>being attacked, then Player 1 loses, and Player 2 wins. The utility function<br>would return 1 for a win for Player 1, or -1 for a win for Player 2. For<br>example, Player 1 can place a queen in the above position, but Player 2 would<br>be unable to play after that, so Player 1 would be the winner. There are no<br>draws.<br>Note: If all N queens are on the board, then the last player to move is the<br>winner: if N is even, then Player 2 wins, and the utility is 1 1, and if odd,<br>Player 1 wins, and the utility is 1 1.There are no draws.</p>
<h3 id="Variation-1b"><a href="#Variation-1b" class="headerlink" title="Variation 1b"></a>Variation 1b</h3><p>This variation is identical to Variation 1a, except for the score of the game.<br>The utility value is calculated by counting how many queens are on the board<br>at the end of a game: if there are k queens on the board, and it’s a win for<br>Player 1, the utility is k (positive, odd number); if there are k queens on<br>the board, and it’s a win for Player 2, the utility is k (negative, even<br>number). For example, the win for Player 1 (after playing one more queen on<br>the board position above) counts for 3. There are no draws.<br>Note: If all N queens are on the board, then the last player to move is the<br>winner: if N is even, then Player 2 wins, and the utility is N , and if odd,<br>Player 1 wins, and the utility is N .</p>
<h3 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a>Notes</h3><ul>
<li>The purpose of this assignment is not to implement a real game, but to understand the game-tree search algorithms. </li>
<li>These variations are games, but may not be interesting games to play as humans. </li>
<li>Some of the variations of this game may not seem fair or balanced, and that’s okay for our work. </li>
<li>For <code>N &lt; 3</code> , the game is quite boring. </li>
<li>Draw out the game trees for <code>N ≤ 4</code> before you start coding. You’ll need these trees to debug your code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Programming"><a href="#Programming" class="headerlink" title="Programming"></a>Programming</h2><p>As in previous assignments, it’s advisable to separate the game-specific code<br>from the game-search code.<br>The interface between your game-search code and your game-specific code is as<br>follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>is_terminal(state): returns a Boolean, True if the given state has no more legal moves. </li>
<li>utility(state): returns a numeric value. The state must be a terminal state. </li>
<li>actions(state): returns a list of actions (i.e., moves) that are legal in the given state. The function needs to examine the state to determine whose turn it is to move. </li>
<li>result(state, action): returns a new game state which is the result of taking the given action in the given state. </li>
<li>Optional: is_maxs_turn(state): Returns a Boolean value, True if it’s Player 1’s turn (Max) in the given state. </li>
<li>Optional: is_mins_turn(state): Returns a Boolean value, True if it’s Player 2’s turn (Min) in the given state.<br>Implementing the optional methods may not be necessary for all the questions,<br>though it would be useful if you wanted to play the game interactively. We saw<br>the use of these optional functions in Lecture 18.<br>None of the coding is difficult, though finding a bug may be difficult. As<br>always, you should write enough tests for your methods and functions that you<br>can debug them using a test script. Debugging a whole application is more of a<br>waste of your time than writing a test script.<br>You’ll be developing a code base throughout this assignment, and we only want<br>to see it once to grade it. Each question will ask you to hand in a script<br>that performs a task; this script can import the code you’re developing, but<br>don’t hand everything in multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Execution-instructions"><a href="#Execution-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Execution instructions"></a>Execution instructions</h3><p>The markers may or may not wish to run your program, to verify your results.<br>To help them, you should provide brief instructions on what to do to get your<br>program running. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming language used (including version, e.g., Java 8 or Python 3) </li>
<li>A simple example of compiling and&#x2F;or running the code from a UNIX shell would be best.<br>Keep it brief, and name it with the question number as the following example:<br>a4q1_EXECUTION.txt. If your assignment uses third party libraries, they have<br>to be included in your submission.<br>Clarification: You’ll submit one file documenting the execution instructions<br>for all your scripts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Clarification-What-to-Hand-in-instructions"><a href="#Clarification-What-to-Hand-in-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Clarification: What to Hand in instructions"></a>Clarification: What to Hand in instructions</h3><p>The first version of this assignment required separate hand in files for<br>questions 1-7,9. This pushes against Moodle’s very hard limit of 20 files<br>maximum. To remedy this, the new requirements collect the requirements for<br>these questions into 2 files:</p>
<ul>
<li>A4_output.txt will contain tables output from your scripts for questions 1-7,9. Please mark each Question’s output clearly, so markers can easily identify which data belongs to which question. </li>
<li>A4_EXECUTION.txt will contain execution instructions for all your scripts for questions 1-7,9. Please mark each Question’s information clearly, so markers can easily identify which information belongs to which question.<br>You should not hand in separate output and execution instructions!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-1"><a href="#Question-1" class="headerlink" title="Question 1"></a>Question 1</h2><p>Purpose: To implement Minimax Search for Variation 1a.<br>Degree of Difficulty: Moderate. Minimax is easy; the game will be the only<br>tricky part.<br>Textbook: AIMA Chapter 5.1, 5.2<br>Implement Minimax search (with no bells or whistles) and apply it to Variation<br>1a, for game sizes <code>N ∈ &#123;1, ..., 10&#125;</code> .</p>
<h3 id="Clarification"><a href="#Clarification" class="headerlink" title="Clarification"></a>Clarification</h3><p>In the above output, which is literally copy&#x2F;paste from my computer, the Best<br>Opening Move is represented by a pair (WHO, ROW); in my implementation, I used<br>the symbol ‘X’ to represent player 1 (answering WHO), and for ROW, I give an<br>integer value. There is no need to imitate my output, as long as it’s clear.<br>Your output should go all the way up to 10 (or 11, if that amuses you). Your<br>output should have the correct Minimax values, though there may be more than<br>one opening move to achieve that value; it does not matter which of the<br>equally good opening moves your script returns. Your times will vary, but<br>reasonably you should expect your implementation to take only a few seconds at<br>most. Try a few larger sizes, e.g. N &#x3D; 11, 12, and observe the exponential<br>nature of the search problem (again).</p>
<h3 id="What-to-Hand-In"><a href="#What-to-Hand-In" class="headerlink" title="What to Hand In"></a>What to Hand In</h3><ul>
<li>A file named a4q1.txt containing your table, as above. </li>
<li>Revised: Your table, and any accompanying explanation, in your file A4_output.txt, which is a single file that will contain your output for all questions. Be sure to mark clearly the question number as you add information to this file. </li>
<li>A file named a4q1.LANG containing a script&#x2F;app which, if executed, would produce the output submitted in a4q1.txt (except the timing information which will differ). Use the file extension appropriate for your choice of programming language, e.g., .py or .java. </li>
<li>A file named a4q1_EXECUTION.txt containing execution instructions for markers to run your script&#x2F;app if they deem it necessary. </li>
<li>Revised: Execution instructions for markers to run your script&#x2F;app if they deem it necessary, clearly presented in a the file A4_EXECUTION.txt, which is a single file that will contain your execution instructions for all questions. Be sure to mark clearly the question number as you add information to this file.<br>Do not submit your entire codebase multiple times. Your script&#x2F;app a4q1.LANG<br>should run correctly, but it should not contain code for Minimax search, and<br>should not contain the code for your implementation of Variation 1a (or any<br>others).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Clarification-1"><a href="#Clarification-1" class="headerlink" title="Clarification"></a>Clarification</h3><p>You’ll be developing your code-base as you work on Questions 1-9. You will<br>hand in your whole code base in Question 10. Your script for Question 1 will<br>import modules&#x2F;classes&#x2F;libraries from (or include, or compile with) your code<br>base, of course! But you don’t need to hand in the game code or the search<br>code in Question 1. Just hand in the script that creates the data above. When<br>the marker runs your script, it should import or compile with the code you<br>submit in Question 10.<br>Be sure to include your name, NSID, student number, and course number at the<br>top of all documents.</p>
<h3 id="Evaluation"><a href="#Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h3><p>Revised:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 marks: Your file A4_output.txt contains the required table, with correct Minimax values, and plausible times, clearly marked as a4q1. </li>
<li>1 mark: Your file a4q1.LANG contains a script&#x2F;app that produces the output in A4_output.txt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-2"><a href="#Question-2" class="headerlink" title="Question 2"></a>Question 2</h2><p>Purpose: To implement Minimax Search for Variation 1b.<br>Degree of Difficulty: Easy. Minimax is done already; you have to modify the<br>utility function for the new variation.<br>Textbook: AIMA Chapter 5.1, 5.2<br>Implement Minimax search (with no bells or whistles) and apply it to Variation<br>1b, for game sizes <code>N ∈ &#123;1, ..., 10&#125;</code> .<br>Your output should go all the way up to 10 (or 11, if that amuses you).

<h3 id="Additional-functions-for-your-interface"><a href="#Additional-functions-for-your-interface" class="headerlink" title="Additional functions for your interface"></a>Additional functions for your interface</h3><p>The textbook recommends that you</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace your test for a terminal state with a function that determines whether to cut off search. </li>
<li>Replace the utility function with a function that estimates utility for any given state.<br>I recommend otherwise! Add two new methods&#x2F;functions to your Variations, as<br>follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>cutoff_test(state, depth): returns a Boolean, True if the search should be terminated at this state and depth. </li>
<li>eval(state): returns an estimate of the Minimax value of the given state.<br>By introducing these two new functions into the interface, your search<br>algorithms need to be modified as well. Use the cutoff test and the evaluation<br>function in combination, but only check for the cut-off after you’ve<br>determined that the state is not an actual terminal state. This arrangement<br>adds a few lines to the search algorithms, but helps keep your utility and<br>estimated minimax functions independent, which is good for development.</li>

You are welcome to<br>try. You should remember that your estimate should return a value in the range<br>of your utility function; a confident estimate should be close to the true<br>minimax value, and you can express uncertainty by producing estimates that are<br>between the extremes, perhaps using fractional (floating point) estimates<br>within the range. Alternatively, your evaluation function can return a random<br>utility value. This is easy to start with, in any case.</p>

You might start by implementing<br>human vs. computer (or computer vs. human), so that you can figure things out,<br>then replace the human player with the computer.<br>You should allow each player to use its own search algorithm, so you could<br>play (plain) Minimax against Alpha-Beta, using equal depth cutoffs, or<br>different depth cutoffs.
