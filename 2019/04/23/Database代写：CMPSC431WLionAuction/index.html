 RequirementLionAuction is a startup project which aims to provide members of Lion StateUniversity (LSU) to sell and buy used or unused goods via online auctions.Hilbert Dude, the founder of this startup, envisages an undeveloped market forsuch an e-commerce platform in university campuses around the world. Afterconducting a preliminary market investigation, Mr. Dude realized the value andpotential of such a platform, which is not only beneficial to the members of auniversity but also to the local economy in the campus and its surroundingcommunity. He came up a simple yet cool brand name “LionAuction” and managedto convince some rich dudes (in the Dude Family) to sponsor an initial roundof funding. Now the LionAuction project is ready to fly.Mr. Dude is not a technical person, so he decides to find a technical team toprototype and validate his business ideas. Through the connection of LionsAlliance (a cross-university organization), he reached out to Professor Lee atPenn State University (PSU), home of Nittany Lions, for assistance to conducta feasibility study on the ideas he has in mind. After discussing somerequirements and manpower needed, Mr. Dude entrusted Professor Lee and histeaching team to advise and support students in CMPSC431W to systematicallydesign and implement prototypes of LionAuction to validate his ideas. The goalis not to produce a complete implementation of the system, as it would requiretoo much time and resources for the students. Instead, students will focus oni) the process of the database design that may pose a significant risk due touncertainty and the lack of understanding in requirements, and ii) theprototyping of certain system functionality as a proof of concept. It isanticipated that based on careful examination of the tested prototypes,valuable insights and lessons may be obtained. Widely accepted, this design-prototype approach of feasibility study is often adopted when the requirementsare not well understood. Moreover, a successful prototype can potentiallyserve as the foundation for the future production ready system. Furthermore,an impressive demonstration of the prototyped system, functions, and uniquefeatures will surely demonstrate the strong creative and technical ability ofPSU students, reaffirming the strong reputation in the IT industry.Mr. Dude has tried to communicate this project roughly and abstractly andexpect students to figure out and fill in all the missing details. You(students in CMPSC431W) will design a databasebacked web application tobuy&#x2F;sell products on campus by members of the university and local community.You will also implement a prototype to demonstrate system functions and yourdesign. As parts of the prototype, you will need to implement programs toaccess data from the designed database to support the functionality of thesystem. The project consists of two phases:  1. Requirement Analysis, Conceptual Database Design, Technology Survey, Logical Database Design and Normalization.  2. Protype ImplementationMr. Dude and Professor Lee ask you (students in CMPSC431W) to envision whatLionAuction will be. Based on the provided project description, you need toanalyze the requirements of LionAuction to determine the system’sfunctionality and to system’s functionality. Furthermore, business rules(integrity constraints) need to be determined and imposed upon the neededdata. Based on your requirement analysis, you are also required to come upwith a conceptual database design by using the entity-relationship model toexpress the data and constraints identified. Students shall also perform atechnology survey by researching on the current web&#x2F;database applicationtechnologies, including web frameworks, programming languages, developmenttools, and database management system, for comparison with those suggested bythe CMPSC431W teaching team, i.e., Flask Web Framework, Python, PyCharmrofessional IDE, and SQLite. Logical database design and schema normalizationare also to be performed in the first phase. Each student will submit a well-documented report for the tasks in Phase 1. After this detailed designprocess, in Phase 2, students will populate the database and implement thesystem functions.##  Overall RequirementsBefore we jump into the description of each phase, please note what you(students in CMPSC431W) are expected to fulfill while working on the project.###  Individual ProjectThis is an INDIVIDUAL Project! Not a team project. Design and implementationshould be done individually based on each student’s OWN ideas!###  Document Report and FormattingThe project report should be written in your own words. Reusing (copying)parts or all of the project description directly not only receives no creditbut also violate academic integrity in terms of Plagiarism!You can prepare your documents using any document typesetting languages&#x2F;tools.We will provide a document template (as .docx file) that you are more thanwelcome to directly follow. However, you are encouraged to create a templateof your own, as long as it maintains a professional image for your cover pageand includes all the components from our provided template. Your report shouldbe converted into one PDF file for submission electronically on Canvas.###  Project ManagementThe success of this project heavily relies on your own personal effort andcommitment. As denoted on the Syllabus and Course Schedule, the project issegmented into two phases. Thus, there will be no intermediate submissionsexcept for a progress review before the final demo. Students are expected toset goals and maintain individual milestones, documented as part of the Phase1 report. For those who do not have prior background on web programming, it ishighly recommended to start reading documentation and tutorials and practicethem during Phase I.Since there are numerous web application tools and frameworks, it isimpossible for the teaching team to provide guidance on every combination oftools. While students have a choice to use the recommended platform and tools(i.e., Flask Web Framework, Python, PyCharm Professional IDE, and SQLite)which the teaching staff are more than happy to provide guidance, you maychoose to adopt platforms, tools, programming languages and databasemanagement systems of your preference (but you are on your own in this case).##  PHASE I - DATABASE DESIGN AND TECHOLOGY SURVEY###  ChecklistTasks  "></a>完成一个类似 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lionauctions.com/" title="LionAuction"> LionAuction </a><br>的在线拍卖二手商品的网站的数据库设计。<br>![LionAuction](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://liontransblob.blob.core.windows.net/lot-images-">https://liontransblob.blob.core.windows.net/lot-images-</a><br>dev&#x2F;ProductId-1&#x2F;08ebac109bac4a498dacc4a9f0f6ae2a.png)<br>##  Requirement<br>LionAuction is a startup project which aims to provide members of Lion State<br>University (LSU) to sell and buy used or unused goods via online auctions.<br>Hilbert Dude, the founder of this startup, envisages an undeveloped market for<br>such an e-commerce platform in university campuses around the world.

class="headerlink" title="Requirement AnalysisConceptual Database DesignTechnology SurveyLogical Database Design and Schema Normalization###  Task 1: Requirement AnalysisLionAuction aims to become an auction-based online e-commerce platform whereuniversity members and local business can buy and sell goods online. Thus, itmay help to explore some online e-commerce websites such as eBay, Amazon,Walmart, Facebook market, etc. for reference to better understand the expected(and alternative) functions and requirements for LionAuction. The following isa general description of the expected functionality for the project,reflecting Mr.Dude’s non-technical point of view of the system. In this task, you shouldenvisage what the system should look like and how it may operate to enable thecampus auction business. You are required to analyze and describe in detailthe system requirements, including the system functions&#x2F;operations, dataneeded to support those system functions&#x2F;operations, the business rules(integrity constraints) of LionAuction to be imposed on the data, andhow&#x2F;where they will be stored and accessed to support the systemfunctionality. Please note that in this task, you are expected to elaborateupon the system functionality in your own words with figures and identify(write down) the data needed to support each functionality as well as theintegrity constraints to be imposed on the data. We first describe LionAuctionfrom the users’ perspective, then add more information on the system.  1. Registered Users: To operate on LionAuction, a user needs to be registered in the system. A registered user is identified by a user ID (e.g., email address) and authenticated with a password. There are three different types of users who will use the system: Bidders, Sellers, and HelpDesk Staffs (HelpDesk in short). In the following, we describe what those three types of users are expected to do with the LionAuction system in their respective roles.    * a. Bidders: While the bidders are targeting on all members of LSU (i.e., students, faculty members, staffs, and so on), we will consider only students in this initial effort. Therefore, all LSU students are bidders by default. It is important to collect and maintain detailed information about bidders in LionAuction, including e-mail address, name, address (which consists of street, city, state, and zipcode), phone number, credit card info (including type of credit card, credit card number, expiration date), major, age, gender, annual income, and etc. Among them, the last four items are collected for marketing analysis, but we won’t tell the bidders that. A bidder may log into LionAuction with their email address (which serves as the user ID) and their existing password. After logging in, they can update their personal information (except for their ID) and reset login password. A bidder can also manage payment information, add&#x2F;remove credit card number which is only viewable&#x2F;accessible to herself&#x2F;himself.Additionally, a bidder may browse the product listings via a categoryhierarchy (subcategories will be selectable in a list&#x2F;menu) to find aninterested product and then start bidding the products. He may also sendquestion about a particular product listing to its sellers. In LionAuction,products are organized based on a category hierarchy. For each product listed,seller info and related product details are shown to the bidder. Productswhich are already sold (auction successful) or terminated by the seller(auction failed) should not be viewable&#x2F;listed to buyers.After a bidder wins an auction, he&#x2F;she pays the winning price right away.After the transaction is completed, the listing will be archived and no longerlisted. The bidder will be able to rate the seller after the transactioncompleted. Note that ratings, meant to serve the community regarding thereputation of sellers, is based on the 5-star rating system.Some bidders may want to put their own items in auctions as well. To do so,the buyer need to fill out an application form and submit it to the HelpDeskfor approval.    * b. Sellers: Similar to bidders, a seller also needs to log into LionAucton with her&#x2F;his user ID (i.e., email address) and password. After the seller log in, she&#x2F;he can update some account information and reset their login password. Sellers are either students of Lion State University or approved local business vendors. Different from bidders, bank routing number, bank account number, and a balance in LionAucton are mainitained for sellers. Additionally, for approved vendors, information such as business name, business address, and customer service phone number must be maintained. Note that LionAuction provides an opportunity for the local venders to market their special products, which are unique and different from big brand-name products. Thus, these products will only be made available by local venders for auctions in some promotional occasions. If a local business seller decides to leave the market, the information of its products will be automatically removed and no longer available in the market.Sellers need to enlist&#x2F;publish the products they want to put up for auctionson LionAuction by providing the product information, the category of product,a reserve price (which is hidden from the bidders) and an auction stop time. Areserve price is the minimum price a seller is willing to accept for the item.At the end of the auction, if no bid is higher than the reserve price, theseller is not obligated to sell the item.For a listed product, a seller can view all the information for the product,and the questions asked by bidders. Sellers can see the ratings on themselvesgiven by the bidders. Sellers can list products under existing categories forsale. If some new products cannot find a fitting category in the categoryhierarchy, the seller needs to submit a request to HelpDesk. Once approved,the HelpDesk Staff will create a new category in the category hierarchy asappropriate.When an auction is ended (either successful or fail), the product will bedelisted (no more visible to the bidders) but the auction informationincluding the bids will be archived in the system. For a successful auction,once the payment is completed by the bidder, the seller will receive thepayment in the account.Intuitively, every product needs to have exactly one category, and everyproduct item is listed for auction by only one seller. For example, John andJane have a shared textbook. They cannot create two separate lists for thesame book. While sellers usually are not limited to selling only one productat a time, we assume a product list contains only one product item forsimplicity. Except the aforementioned case where information about productsmade by local business vendors information got deleted automatically when theyleave the market, LionAuction is responsible for maintaining historicallistings of sold products and bidding history for market research andimprovement purposes, regardless if their sellers are no longer listed in theplatform.    * c. HelpDesk: LionAuction will hire a team of IT staffs to manage the system and provide various services. For example, other users (bidders and sellers) may not change their user IDs. They need to submit a request to the HelpDesk team to make the change. Likewise, for a bidder to upgrade his role to a seller and for a seller to add a new category in the category hierarchy, these requests all need to go through HelpDesk. Additionally, they also perform some marketing analysis tasks, e.g., listing the number of auctions put forth by sellers in different majors.The above descriptions are given by taking the views of different users ofLionAuction. In the following, we describe the Products, Bids, Categories,which are important information to be managed in LionAuction.    * d. Products: Every product belongs to exactly one category. Every product item is listed by exactly one seller. For each auction, only one product is listed. If multiple items of the same product, e.g., two cow books, are listed, they are auctioned together. Products should contain some useful information that help the buyer to find the product (i.e., via browsing or search) before making a bid. Important information regarding a product like title, product detail, category and reserve price are required. However, additional information which you (CMPSC431W Students) believe to be important can be included, as creativity is always highly appreciated and encouraged! Finally, as mentioned previously, products by local business are unique. Their information will no longer be available if the business vendor leaves the market.    * e. Bidding: A bidder can place one or more bids on a product list as long as they are not the seller of the product. Each bid that is placed must be at least $1 higher than all previous bids and must be placed before the auction ends. At the end of the auction, the seller via LionAuction notifies all bidders the highest bid. With the notification, the bidder who won the auction can complete the payment transaction. An auction starts when the seller publishes the product for auction and ends exactly at the time the seller specified. Again, all historic auction information should be maintained no matter the transaction is successful or failed.    * f. Category hierarchy: A category is a generalization of a group of products. It is a higherlevel unit of products. Categories available in the platform are predefined by the HelpDesk team. As mentioned, for sellers to put up a new product of some non-existing category for auction, they can send a request to HelpDesk for approval. Once approved, it’s the job of HelpDesk to create a new category for the item in the category hierarchy. Note that, in the category hierarchy, one category may have multiple subcategories, except the leaves (i.e., the lowest level) of the category hierarchy. The number of products within a category is unlimited. Therefore, the buyers can traverse the category hierarchy to narrow down the interested products in a specific category.From the above description, you may tell that Mr. Dude is not a CS engineer.The description mainly reflects some rough ideas he had in his mind. Forexample, he didn’t even think about how a bidder may search availableproducts, in addition to browse the category hierarchy. Moreover, afterfinding some interesting products, a bidder may also see what other productsare offered by the same seller. In addition, there are various potential ideasto explore. To get the project moving forward (and to educate him, yourcustomer), you may fill in the missing information, make suggestions, andinject your own ideas with clear elaboration and justification in your Phase 1report (for potential extra credit).###  Task 2: Conceptual Database DesignBased on the result of Task 1, you should present an entity-relationship (ER)diagram describing your conceptual database design. Also, your report shouldinclude a narrative description on all aspects of the diagram in detail. Inaddition to an overall ER-diagram of your conceptual design, parts of the ERdiagram such as entities, relationships and integrity constraints are expectedto be explained in detail. Note that the conceptual database design isapplication-oriented. Please do not assume the underlying database system(just yet) and thus do not map your design into relations in this task.###  Task 3: Technology SurveyAn aspect of working in the IT industry is to always keep your knowledgeupdated with the current market trends and technology innovations. Thus, forthe project, it’s important for you to have a good knowledge of the currentweb programming and database technology. A technology survey is meant for youto research a breadth of various web programming frameworks (for applicationdevelopment), programming languages, tools (e.g., IDE), and databasemanagement systems as well as the trends in those technological areas. Besidetaking into consideration the web programming stack suggested by the CMPSC431Wteaching team, i.e., Flask, Python, PyCharmIDE, SQLite, you have to come up with at least three trending alternatives into make a comparison with the software&#x2F;language mentioned above. It isexpected for you to write persuasively about which tools you think as the bestfit for the project. Please consider as many aspects as possible regarding theroles of those technologies in your project, and to justify your ownrecommendation by discussing the reasons, pros and cons of your choices. Alsodiscuss the impact and relevance of those technology trends to the computerscience fields and a broader segment of society or business&#x2F;industry.###  Task 4: Logical Database Design and NormalizationBased on the Requirement Analysis and Conceptual Database (ER) design youdeveloped in Task 1-2; you will finalize the relational schema for thedatabase in LionAuction. You should produce a refined schema that reduces dataredundancy to an acceptable level (i.e., the final schemas need to be at leastin the 3rd Normal Form) while not unduly affecting performance. Your schemasshould also support the enforcement of most, if not all, of the integrityconstraints that you identify in this phase as well as those newly identifiedor added after relational schemas are generated from the ER diagram. In thistask, we assume two functional dependencies have been identified: a) zip codesin address determines state and cities; b) student email address whichdetermines the login password. You should present the specific details of howthe process of schema generation and normalization is done, i.e., you areexpected to apply both of translating the ER diagram to relations and thenperform schema normalization. Your report should also include a narrativedescription with illustration of the translation (mapping) and normalization.###  GradingDifferent from exams, the project provides a way for students to show theircommitment and effort in learning and practicing the knowledge learned fromCMPSC431W. While the course project is work intensive, students who show theirstrong motivation and effort through the high quality of their reports will berewarded. The project report, fulfilling the Writing requirement of the PennState curriculum, is graded in terms of correctness, completeness,presentation, and clarity. Again, your effort will be reflected in your reportand rewarded. Please be reminded that the project is work intensive – startearly and prioritize your time.Extra credit of up to 10% will be rewarded for reports which include at least1 new functionality (i.e., proposed by you, not stated in the above projectdescription), expressed explicitly and clearly within the report. The dataneeded for the new functionality should also be specified, modeled, andrefined in Task 1, 2, and 4, like other data in the project. This extra creditis graded on novelty of the new functionality as well as clarity the studentis able to present in various tasks of Phase 1.###  SubmissionAs mentioned above, a template will be provided as a .docx which serves as amandatory style guideline. The deliverable is a report in PDF containing therequirement analysis, conceptual database design, technology survey, andlogical database design and normalization. The document must have pagenumbers, section numbers and a table of contents. Figures should be used forillustration of your design. In addition, the document should also include aproject plan (including schedule, deliverables, and milestones) as an appendixin the project report.The length of the body of this report, excluding the cover page, table ofcontents, list of figures and list of tables, is expected to be no less than10 pages. However, based on our experience, 10 pages are usually not enough tocomplete all the tasks in Phase 1 of the project with sufficient detail! Thereis no upper limit on the number of pages in your document. You may use as manypages as you like (hopefully not exceeding 50 pages) to produce a complete andimpressive report.##  PHASE II - SYSTEM PROTOTYPEThe PSU students have sent in their design proposals to Mr. Dude, who with theassistance of Professor Lee and his teaching team has determined the bestconceptual and logical database designs which match what they had in mind.Now, Mr. Dude wants to validate the idea by prototyping a web applicationbased on the selected logical database design and see how it work. To make iteasier to compare different implementations, Mr. Dude has compiled a dataset(in the form of CSV files) based on a reduced set of relational schemas, whichwill be used by the students to populate the database and test the prototypedsystem functionality. For evaluation, the student implementations will betested&#x2F;evaluated based on the ability to execute the designated tasks and theoverall user experience (UX) from using the website.The relational schemas for LionAuction have been provided in a separatedocument. You are expected to follow these relational schemas for Phase 2.However, you can make changes to the schemas as long as you use the data fromthe CSV files we provide. You may also extend the schemas to create new tablesfor new features you would like to implement. In that case, you will need toprepare data for the corresponding tables for testing and final demonstration.###  ChecklistTask  "></a>Requirement Analysis<br>Conceptual Database Design<br>Technology Survey<br>Logical Database Design and Schema Normalization<br>###  Task 1: Requirement Analysis<br>LionAuction aims to become an auction-based online e-commerce platform where<br>university members and local business can buy and sell goods online. Thus, it<br>may help to explore some online e-commerce websites such as eBay, Amazon,<br>Walmart, Facebook market, etc. for reference to better understand the expected<br>(and alternative) functions and requirements for LionAuction. The following is<br>a general description of the expected functionality for the project,<br>reflecting Mr.<br>Dude’s non-technical point of view of the system. In this task, you should<br>envisage what the system should look like and how it may operate to enable the<br>campus auction business. You are required to analyze and describe in detail<br>the system requirements, including the system functions&#x2F;operations, data<br>needed to support those system functions&#x2F;operations, the business rules<br>(integrity constraints) of LionAuction to be imposed on the data, and<br>how&#x2F;where they will be stored and accessed to support the system<br>functionality. Please note that in this task, you are expected to elaborate<br>upon the system functionality in your own words with figures and identify<br>(write down) the data needed to support each functionality as well as the<br>integrity constraints to be imposed on the data. We first describe LionAuction<br>from the users’ perspective, then add more information on the system.<br>  1. Registered Users: To operate on LionAuction, a user needs to be registered in the system. A registered user is identified by a user ID (e.g., email address) and authenticated with a password. There are three different types of users who will use the system: Bidders, Sellers, and HelpDesk Staffs (HelpDesk in short). In the following, we describe what those three types of users are expected to do with the LionAuction system in their respective roles.<br>    * a. Bidders: While the bidders are targeting on all members of LSU (i.e., students, faculty members, staffs, and so on), we will consider only students in this initial effort. Therefore, all LSU students are bidders by default. It is important to collect and maintain detailed information about bidders in LionAuction, including e-mail address, name, address (which consists of street, city, state, and zipcode), phone number, credit card info (including type of credit card, credit card number, expiration date), major, age, gender, annual income, and etc. Among them, the last four items are collected for marketing analysis, but we won’t tell the bidders that. A bidder may log into LionAuction with their email address (which serves as the user ID) and their existing password. After logging in, they can update their personal information (except for their ID) and reset login password. A bidder can also manage payment information, add&#x2F;remove credit card number which is only viewable&#x2F;accessible to herself&#x2F;himself.<br>Additionally, a bidder may browse the product listings via a category<br>hierarchy (subcategories will be selectable in a list&#x2F;menu) to find an<br>interested product and then start bidding the products. He may also send<br>question about a particular product listing to its sellers. In LionAuction,<br>products are organized based on a category hierarchy. For each product listed,<br>seller info and related product details are shown to the bidder. Products<br>which are already sold (auction successful) or terminated by the seller<br>(auction failed) should not be viewable&#x2F;listed to buyers.<br>After a bidder wins an auction, he&#x2F;she pays the winning price right away.<br>After the transaction is completed, the listing will be archived and no longer<br>listed. The bidder will be able to rate the seller after the transaction<br>completed. Note that ratings, meant to serve the community regarding the<br>reputation of sellers, is based on the 5-star rating system.<br>Some bidders may want to put their own items in auctions as well. To do so,<br>the buyer need to fill out an application form and submit it to the HelpDesk<br>for approval.<br>    * b. Sellers: Similar to bidders, a seller also needs to log into LionAucton with her&#x2F;his user ID (i.e., email address) and password. After the seller log in, she&#x2F;he can update some account information and reset their login password. Sellers are either students of Lion State University or approved local business vendors. Different from bidders, bank routing number, bank account number, and a balance in LionAucton are mainitained for sellers. Additionally, for approved vendors, information such as business name, business address, and customer service phone number must be maintained. Note that LionAuction provides an opportunity for the local venders to market their special products, which are unique and different from big brand-name products. Thus, these products will only be made available by local venders for auctions in some promotional occasions. If a local business seller decides to leave the market, the information of its products will be automatically removed and no longer available in the market.<br>Sellers need to enlist&#x2F;publish the products they want to put up for auctions<br>on LionAuction by providing the product information, the category of product,<br>a reserve price (which is hidden from the bidders) and an auction stop time. A<br>reserve price is the minimum price a seller is willing to accept for the item.<br>At the end of the auction, if no bid is higher than the reserve price, the<br>seller is not obligated to sell the item.<br>For a listed product, a seller can view all the information for the product,<br>and the questions asked by bidders. Sellers can see the ratings on themselves<br>given by the bidders. Sellers can list products under existing categories for<br>sale. If some new products cannot find a fitting category in the category<br>hierarchy, the seller needs to submit a request to HelpDesk. Once approved,<br>the HelpDesk Staff will create a new category in the category hierarchy as<br>appropriate.<br>When an auction is ended (either successful or fail), the product will be<br>delisted (no more visible to the bidders) but the auction information<br>including the bids will be archived in the system. For a successful auction,<br>once the payment is completed by the bidder, the seller will receive the<br>payment in the account.<br>Intuitively, every product needs to have exactly one category, and every<br>product item is listed for auction by only one seller. For example, John and<br>Jane have a shared textbook. They cannot create two separate lists for the<br>same book. While sellers usually are not limited to selling only one product<br>at a time, we assume a product list contains only one product item for<br>simplicity. Except the aforementioned case where information about products<br>made by local business vendors information got deleted automatically when they<br>leave the market, LionAuction is responsible for maintaining historical<br>listings of sold products and bidding history for market research and<br>improvement purposes, regardless if their sellers are no longer listed in the<br>platform.<br>    * c. HelpDesk: LionAuction will hire a team of IT staffs to manage the system and provide various services. For example, other users (bidders and sellers) may not change their user IDs. They need to submit a request to the HelpDesk team to make the change. Likewise, for a bidder to upgrade his role to a seller and for a seller to add a new category in the category hierarchy, these requests all need to go through HelpDesk. Additionally, they also perform some marketing analysis tasks, e.g., listing the number of auctions put forth by sellers in different majors.<br>The above descriptions are given by taking the views of different users of<br>LionAuction. In the following, we describe the Products, Bids, Categories,<br>which are important information to be managed in LionAuction.<br>    * d. Products: Every product belongs to exactly one category. Every product item is listed by exactly one seller. For each auction, only one product is listed. If multiple items of the same product, e.g., two cow books, are listed, they are auctioned together. Products should contain some useful information that help the buyer to find the product (i.e., via browsing or search) before making a bid. Important information regarding a product like title, product detail, category and reserve price are required. However, additional information which you (CMPSC431W Students) believe to be important can be included, as creativity is always highly appreciated and encouraged! Finally, as mentioned previously, products by local business are unique. Their information will no longer be available if the business vendor leaves the market.<br>    * e. Bidding: A bidder can place one or more bids on a product list as long as they are not the seller of the product. Each bid that is placed must be at least $1 higher than all previous bids and must be placed before the auction ends. At the end of the auction, the seller via LionAuction notifies all bidders the highest bid. With the notification, the bidder who won the auction can complete the payment transaction. An auction starts when the seller publishes the product for auction and ends exactly at the time the seller specified. Again, all historic auction information should be maintained no matter the transaction is successful or failed.<br>    * f. Category hierarchy: A category is a generalization of a group of products. It is a higherlevel unit of products. Categories available in the platform are predefined by the HelpDesk team. As mentioned, for sellers to put up a new product of some non-existing category for auction, they can send a request to HelpDesk for approval. Once approved, it’s the job of HelpDesk to create a new category for the item in the category hierarchy. Note that, in the category hierarchy, one category may have multiple subcategories, except the leaves (i.e., the lowest level) of the category hierarchy. The number of products within a category is unlimited. Therefore, the buyers can traverse the category hierarchy to narrow down the interested products in a specific category.<br>From the above description, you may tell that Mr. Dude is not a CS engineer.<br>The description mainly reflects some rough ideas he had in his mind. For<br>example, he didn’t even think about how a bidder may search available<br>products, in addition to browse the category hierarchy. Moreover, after<br>finding some interesting products, a bidder may also see what other products<br>are offered by the same seller. In addition, there are various potential ideas<br>to explore. To get the project moving forward (and to educate him, your<br>customer), you may fill in the missing information, make suggestions, and<br>inject your own ideas with clear elaboration and justification in your Phase 1<br>report (for potential extra credit).<br>###  Task 2: Conceptual Database Design<br>Based on the result of Task 1, you should present an entity-relationship (ER)<br>diagram describing your conceptual database design. Also, your report should<br>include a narrative description on all aspects of the diagram in detail. In<br>addition to an overall ER-diagram of your conceptual design, parts of the ER<br>diagram such as entities, relationships and integrity constraints are expected<br>to be explained in detail.

Beside<br>taking into consideration the web programming stack suggested by the CMPSC431W<br>teaching team, i.e., Flask, Python, PyCharm<br>IDE, SQLite, you have to come up with at least three trending alternatives in<br>to make a comparison with the software&#x2F;language mentioned above. It is<br>expected for you to write persuasively about which tools you think as the best<br>fit for the project. Please consider as many aspects as possible regarding the<br>roles of those technologies in your project, and to justify your own<br>recommendation by discussing the reasons, pros and cons of your choices.

<h3 id="Project-Description"><a href="#Project-Description" class="headerlink" title="Project Description"></a>Project Description</h3><p>In Phase II, you will be provided with the following materials: i) a database<br>schema design and ii) CSV files which contain the raw data (released on Canvas<br>under &#x2F;Modules&#x2F;Project&#x2F;). You are supposed to populate the data in accordance<br>with the schema into the database. In addition to this, you will implement the<br>web application for LionAuction and demonstrate the functionality of<br>LionAuction as detailed in Task 3 below.</p>
<h3 id="Task-1-Project-Kickstart-and-Progress-Review"><a href="#Task-1-Project-Kickstart-and-Progress-Review" class="headerlink" title="Task 1: Project Kickstart and Progress Review"></a>Task 1: Project Kickstart and Progress Review</h3><p>We will kickstart the implementation phase of the LionAuction project soon and<br>have a project review to serve as the checkpoint of your progress. You are<br>expected to complete and showcase to the teaching team at least the following<br>tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database population (Users table) </li>
<li>UserLogIn (Basic Authentication)<br>You will be given 5 minutes to demonstrate the above. We will post the<br>schedule for the progress review and signup sheet for your respective project<br>demos. Please note that all files of your code have to be submitted on CANVAS<br>in a zip file. You have to include a ReadMe file to describe your code<br>functionality and control flow. Your code has to be properly documented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Task-2-Database-Population"><a href="#Task-2-Database-Population" class="headerlink" title="Task 2: Database Population"></a>Task 2: Database Population</h3><p>The first task is to create and populate the database. You will be provided<br>with large data files where the columns contain values for various fields.<br>However, please note that those are RAW data. In other words, they may not<br>comply to the integrity constraints. You are supposed to organize the raw<br>values in the files based on the schema provided to create all of the<br>necessary tables, define primary keys, foreign keys, and specify any integrity<br>constraints as appropriate. In addition, define any views of the schema as you<br>see appropriate. Again, please inspect all the columns and the corresponding<br>data types in the CSV files before you proceed to populate the database. To<br>support additional functionality you wish to add, you are encouraged to<br>augment the schema and add your own data. You can use Python libraries like<br>Pandas or other database facilities&#x2F;tools to parse the CSV files and insert<br>values to the table. You should provide and maintain the scripts (or<br>documentation of steps) used in your data population, so that you can easily<br>regenerate the database or restore the database states. There were some rare<br>cases of data loss or tables being corrupted during implementation. Data<br>loss&#x2F;corruption cannot be used as an excuse for project incompletion or<br>deadline extension. You need to be prepared for such events.</p>
<h3 id="Task-3-Functionality-Implementation"><a href="#Task-3-Functionality-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Task 3: Functionality Implementation"></a>Task 3: Functionality Implementation</h3><p>You need to prototype (i.e., implement) the system functionality as specified<br>below and demonstrate how they operate on your final system prototype. The<br>following is a description of the expected functionality.</p>
<ol>
<li>UserLogIn (Complete): This is for a user (seller, bidder or helpdesk) to log in. Note that the log-in information of users is stored inside the LionAuction system (after data population). The system recognizes the user by his&#x2F;her email and password. Please be sure that the user’s password is hashed when you store it and it is not displayed while being entered. Note that a user may have multiple roles (i.e., seller, bidder or helpdesk). Extending the basic version of the UserLogIn, the LionAuction system should facilitate its users to specify their roles in the login process and allow them to switch roles after login. Based on the specific role, a user will enter a welcome webpage, where allowable operations can be performed by the user. As part of UserLogIn, personal information of the user (e.g., a bidder has name, email ID, age, gender, major, billing address, which includes street, city, state and zipcode, last four digits of credit card number and so on, while a seller and a helpdesk staff have other information) can be displayed&#x2F;checked based on your design. This welcome page should also provide entry points for other operations, e.g., a bidder may browse the categories to find an auction listing of interest; showing the status of those auctions the bidder has participated in so the bidder may continue to bid; and so on. Please consider possible scenarios in your design to provide a good user experience (UX). </li>
<li>CategoryBrowsing: The auction listings available at LionAuction are categorized based on a predefined category hierarchy in the categories table. Each node (i.e., a category with a descriptive name) is associated with a set of auction listings which belong to the category and a number of subcategories, each of which includes its own auction listings. The root of the hierarchy, labeled as ‘All’, do not have any auction listing associated but a number of top-level subcategories. When a user clicks an auction listing, the auction details, such as auction title, product information, seller information, a product photo (optional), quantity, remaining number of bids, and so on, are displayed, along with a button to facilitate bidding. A user can traverse the category hierarchy by clicking on a subcategory to see the product items under this specific category. In each traversing step, you are required to dynamically query that database to find the next-level subcategories for display Note that the category hierarchy exists in the database logically. Retrieving the whole set of categories all together to build (hardcode) a category hierarchy in the application space is not preferred and will receive only a partial credit. </li>
<li>AuctionListing: This is for a seller to publish&#x2F;take off an auction listing in LionAuction. For publishing, detailed information of an auction listing (e.g., title, product details, category, and so on) should be entered before the listing is published. The published auction listing should be immediately available for display in its category when users browsing the category hierarchy. The seller can also make changes on an auction listing (active or inactive, but not sold listings). The seller may also take a published auction listing off the market, but useful information about this auction listing, including the remaining number of bids and reasons to take it off the market, should be maintained. Note that the provided schemas and datasets do not have information about remaining number of bids and reasons to take it off the LionAuction market, so you need to extend the database to support it for new auction listings. As part of this functionality, the auction listings of a seller should be properly grouped (as active, inactive and sold) and displayed to the seller for further actions, i.e., take off market and make changes. </li>
<li>AuctionBidding: This is for a bidder to place a bid on an auction. As described previously, a new bid must be at least $1 higher than all previous bids and must be placed before the auction ends (controlled by Max_bids instead of an auction stop time, for ease of demonstration). After a bid is placed, the auction details (also see that in CategoryBrowsing), along with updated number of remaining bids, should be displayed. A bidder cannot bid again until another bid is placed by a competitor. Please consider the scenarios of bidding to provide a good user experience. Once the auction ends, all bidders should be notified with the bidding result. The notification of the winning bid (i.e., the final bid with a price greater than the reserve price) should lead the bidder enter the payment process, i.e., a new page where credit card information can be entered by or retrieved for the buyer. When the payment is submitted, the payment transaction is recorded in the database. Meanwhile, the status of the auction is changed to “Sold”, i.e., it is still maintained in the database instead of being deleted. However, this auction listing should not be available&#x2F;found&#x2F;displayed in LionAuction anymore.<br>In addition to the functionality listed above, you may choose to implement one<br>or more of the functionalities below for extra credits.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Optional-functionality-to-implement"><a href="#Optional-functionality-to-implement" class="headerlink" title="Optional functionality to implement:"></a>Optional functionality to implement:</h3><ol>
<li>HelpDeskSupport: To support this functionality, sellers and bidders should have interfaces (i.e., webpages) to send their requests to the team of helpdesk staffs, initially assigned to a pseudo staff <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection"> [email protected] </a> . The types of requests, including change user ID, add a new category, and performing a market analysis. At the welcome page to a HelpDesk staff, information of unassigned requests and requests have been assigned to the staff should be displayed, so the staff can claim an unassigned request and perform an assigned requests. Due to limited time in the final review, you only need to implement the request for “adding a new category”. After the request is completed, the request status becomes “completed”, which should be reflected properly in the system. </li>
<li>AccountRegisterUpdate: This allows a new user to create a new account and update personal information in the account, except user id which can only be changed by a<br>HelpDesk staff.</li>
<li>AuctionPromotion: This is for a bidder to quickly see&#x2F;find an auction in promotion. A seller can promote an auction list by paying a promotion fee (i.e., 5% of the reserve price) in order to display it on the top of the category hierarchy, i.e., the All node&#x2F;page. Note that a promoted auction will also be displayed when its associated category node is visited. </li>
<li>Searching: A user can search the auction lists by entering some keywords. The search result is displayed to the user. </li>
<li>Rating: After a bidder wins an auction and competes the payment, the bidder can rate the seller. The rating on the seller is recorded and used to calculate a new average rating of the seller. The new rating should be reflected as part of seller information when it is displayed in the system.<br>Please note that while the correctness of functionality above is critical, the<br>design of a userfriendly web interface and user experience is also very<br>important to the success of the prototype. As we expect this system to impress<br>Mr. Dude and potential investors, and provide excellent user experiences to<br>its users, i.e., the students of Lion State University, please pay attention<br>and effort to the web design of the prototype.<br>Finally, risk management is critical to your project. To protect your<br>implementation effort and product from disasters, please backup all the data,<br>codes, scripts, and documentation in safe external storage.</li>

<h3 id="Task-4-Group-Representation-Reflection"><a href="#Task-4-Group-Representation-Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Task 4: Group Representation - Reflection"></a>Task 4: Group Representation - Reflection</h3><p>At the end of project, the course members of CMPSC431W will form teams to<br>revisit the (different) decisions made by team members throughout different<br>stages of their projects. It’s beneficial for course members to flash back<br>what were expected at the beginning of the project and reflect on whether the<br>goals set back then have been met. Make a comparison between what was<br>expected, and what has been achieved. Discuss the lessons learned - for<br>example, why some parts of the required functionality were not completed (if<br>any), how you added some new features (and why, if any), how you would proceed<br>with the project the same or differently in the way you do in the course, and<br>your thoughts about the project and suggestions to Mr. Dude, etc. Have a team<br>to make a group presentation will allow the group members to share thoughts<br>and exchange experiences learned from the project. The group members will<br>obtain in-depth insights to enrich the presentation through brainstorming,<br>discussion and collaboration and pave their roads toward bright futures.<br>Please plan and include the reflections as part of the group video<br>presentation (see more details of the video presentation in the Deliverables<br>section below).</p>
<h3 id="Final-Deliverables"><a href="#Final-Deliverables" class="headerlink" title="Final Deliverables"></a>Final Deliverables</h3><p>The final deliverables in Phase 2 include a video presentation and a<br>demonstration of the LionAuction system.<br>In group video presentation (no more than 6 minutes), please discuss&#x2F;review<br>different tasks you performed at different stages of the project, i.e., not<br>only the prototype implementation in Phase 2 but also the database design in<br>Phase 1 to make a reflection. Note that the video presentation is not a<br>recording of your project demonstration. Please exploit the opportunity<br>provided by the group work to revisit&#x2F;compare various important design and<br>implementation decisions you considered to share thoughts, suggestions and<br>ideas for future. More information and guidance regarding the group work will<br>be discussed in classes and announced on Canvas. Your group video presentation<br>should be submitted via Canvas.<br>In the project demonstration, you are expected to show your prototype<br>implementation of the LionAuction system to the teaching team. We will test<br>the prototyped website and check some&#x2F;all of the compulsory tasks with data<br>from the CSV files provided to you. You may also show the optional<br>functionality for extra credits. Please be well-versed with your code as we<br>may ask you to explain the web&#x2F;application server code and the queries you<br>wrote. Please note that all files of your codes, scripts, databases and<br>documents, organized in a project directory ready for execution in PyCharm<br>Prof. or the IDE of your choice, have to be submitted on CANVAS as a zip file.<br>You have to include a ReadMe file as requested previously in Web Programming<br>Exercise. It should provide i) context of your code (i.e., background<br>information such as what they are used for); ii) features (i.e.,<br>functions&#x2F;operations of the codes); iii) organization (i.e., how the files are<br>organized); iv) instructions (i.e., how to run the code, including how and<br>where to load the files into PyCharm Professional). Your codes have to be<br>properly documented for full credits.<br>As stated in classes and the syllabus, academic integrity is the most<br>important – there will be no tolerance and exceptions towards violation! An<br>incomplete but attempted submission is always far better than committing an<br>academic integrity violation.<br>Your extra efforts will be rewarded with extra credits!</p>
